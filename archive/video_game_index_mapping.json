        "text": "Patapon is a 2007 rhythm video game developed by Pyramid and Japan Studio and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation Portable. The game's unique genre was described to be a combination of rhythm and strategy. The game's concept and design were conceived when game designer Hiroyuki Kotani discovered the Patapon designs from French artist Rolito's personal website. The name Patapon was created by Rolito and was inspired by an old French word for \"children\". Kotani chose the name because it sounded similar to marching and drumming. It was released in Japan in December 2007 and in February 2008 for North America and Europe. In the game, the player acts as an invisible deity to a tribe of anthropomorphic eyeballs known as \"Patapons\" that can be commanded to move forward, attack, defend and retreat by using a sequence of drum beats. The story follows the Patapon tribe in their journey to reach Earthend and gaze upon \"IT\". They encounter giant beasts and an enemy tribe known as the Zigotons that serve as obstacles throughout their adventure. Patapon was well-received among critics with multiple reviewers praising the art style of the Patapon tribe and the music. Some reviewers criticized the repetitive nature of it and the lack of a pause option. The game received multiple nominations including a BAFTA award and won Best PSP Game of 2008 by IGN. The game was followed up by two sequels for the PSP; Patapon 2 and Patapon 3. A remastered version for the PlayStation 4 was released in 2017, with another remaster, bundled with its sequel as Patapon 1+2 Replay being released for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 and Windows. In Patapon, the player takes the role of a deity worshipped by an anthropomorphic eye-ball army known as Patapons. The Patapon village serves as the main hub, allowing the player to revive fallen troops, select missions, and play minigames. Before each mission, the player can choose up to three different units for battle with the banner-wielding Hatapon as the leader of the units. There are eight possible units to choose from: The shield and sword-wielding Tatepons, the spear-wielding Yaripons, the bow and arrow-wielding Yumipons, the cavalry lance-wielding Kibapons, the heavy club-wielding Dekapons, bird-riding Toripons, magic-wielding Mahopons, and Tuba-wielding Megapons. Each unit can have a maximum of three or six troops depending on the type of Patapon. During missions, the player can command the Patapons by inputting specific sequences using the face buttons on the PSP, each representing a drum. These sequences can command the tribe to move forward, attack, defend, and other actions. A pulsating border signals the player at what rhythm to input the commands. Successfully entering a proper sequence in sync with the rhythm will lead the tribe into a \"Fever\" increasing their attack and defensive bonuses. Fever can be accomplished by maintaining a combination of 10, or achieved early if a combination is 3 or higher and the command was performed perfectly in sync. If the player ceases to command the Patapons or inputs the commands off-beat of the border's rhythm, the combo and fever will be lost. During fever, Miracles can be performed that affect the weather. Examples include summoning rain to cool a scorching desert or summoning strong winds assisting in the range of the Yumipons'arrows. Once a mission is complete, the player can return to an earlier mission to acquire additional resources and equipment to build up their troops before a larger battle. Materials, weapons, armour, and a currency known as \"Ka-ching\" can be gained by fallen enemies to fortify the player's troops. If a Patapon is defeated in battle, it will drop a cap that can be used to revive the Patapon once the mission is completed. If the cap is not retrieved during the mission, the Patapon is permanently lost. New Patapons can be created in the Patapon village using the tree of life and requires Ka-ching and materials such as sticks, stones, and branches. Using rarer versions of those materials creates stronger variants of the Patapons. Patapon follows the tribe of the eponymous eyeball-like creatures, Patapons. In the distant past, the Patapons were a flourishing nation led by their deity, the Mighty Patapon, on a journey to Earthend to gaze upon an enigmatic object known as \"IT\". The Patapons at one point were banished to the desolate frontier by their sworn enemy of similar eyeball-like creatures known as the Zigotons. The game begins with the Mighty Patapon reuniting with the banner-wielding Hatapon. The Mighty Patapon is led back to the remnants of the tribe to resume their journey to Earthend. The Patapon face large enemies throughout their travels and re-encounter the Zigoton empire. The Zigoton general, Gong the Hawkeye, challenged the Patapons multiple times by provoking them using Patapon hostages and eventually having a final duel. Shortly before his death, Gong reveals to them that the Zigotons have their version of the prophecy foretelling that the world will fall into chaos when the Patapons gaze at \"IT\". As the Patapons progress on their journey, many of the Zigoton warriors sell their souls to the dark forces in exchange for power in an attempt to defeat them. Eventually, the ruler of the Zigotons, Queen Kharma, sells her soul in a final effort to destroy the Patapons. When she is defeated, a gateway to the Dark World unleashes the ancient demon, Gorl. The Patapons manage to defeat Gorl and reach the coastline to witness the sunrise which they assume is Earthend and \"IT\" respectively. However, unfulfilled by the anticlimactic end of their journey, they realize the rising sun is not \"IT\" and they have not reached Earthend. Queen Kharma joins the Patapons and admits that the Zigotons also fooled themselves into believing the sun was \"IT\". The game concludes with the Patapons and Zigotons working together to build a ship. Patapon was developed by Pyramid, produced by Japan Studio, and designed by Hiroyuki Kotani. The game was originally announced on June 11, 2007, during the E3 2007 press conference. The designs for the Patapons were created in 2002 by French artist Rolito and were featured on his personal website in 2004. When Kotani discovered their design, he envisioned the creatures marching into battle and chose to create a video game entirely based on their design. Kotani contacted Rolito through a representative group known as Interlink in 2005 and recruited him to develop the game using the Patapon characters. Rolito was tasked with creating a fictional universe for the characters. The development team would provide drafts and be evaluated by Rolito. Once approved, Rolito would provide the final design. The name \"Patapon\" was conceived by Rolito taken from an old French nursery rhyme that used the word \"Patapon\" for children. Kotani chose the name due to it resembling the sounds of drums and marching. The game developed for two years with the first 21 months developing the prototype and the remaining 3 months dedicated to mass production. Kotani aimed to create a game that never existed before but also to make the game simple. Kotani recruited Pyramid to develop their game based on their previous work. The original concept of Patapon was to control the characters using adjectives and complex grammar, however, was simplified to making the commands more onomatopoeic once the name was decided. Due to Patapon having a unique genre with no established name, Kotani dubbed the genre \"Command Carnival\". The game was developed with the ability to be played as a simple game and as a complex game depending on the player's preference. One of the most difficult challenges to develop was the dialogue for the enemy army, Zigoton, due to the player possibly unable to read it during gameplay. Kemmei Adachi served as composer while Kotani wrote the lyrics. Kemmei was recruited from the game's conception and proposed ideas to develop the game. Music was composed of multiple African instruments. Pyramid proposed to make the Patapons sing back to the player once a command was sent. Vocals for the songs were provided by Kotani's son who was 10 years old at the time. Patapon was released in Japan on December 20, 2007. It was later released in Europe on February 22, 2008, and in North America on February 26, 2008. To promote the game, an event was held from December 5 to December 17, 2007 at the Sample Lab in Omotesand≈ç, Tokyo. A demo was released on February 7, 2008 in Japan. A different demo for North America and Europe was released later on February 14, 2008 and included an exclusive weapon that can be transferred to the full release. The game was ported onto PlayStation 4 under the title, Patapon Remastered, and was released worldwide on August 1, 2017. A second remaster, bundled with its sequel as Patapon 1+2 Replay will be released for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 and Windows on July 12, 2025 by Bandai Namco Entertainment. Developed by sAs, developer of the Theatrhythm series, it further enhances on gameplay and graphics from the original; multiplayer is exclusive to the Nintendo Switch version. Patapon received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to review aggregator website Metacritic. IGN's Jeff Hayes considers Patapon, \"not only one of the best rhythm games ever released, it's also one of the best titles for the PSP.\" GameSpot reviewer Justin Calvert gave Patapon cited its excellent art design and innovative gameplay. Nick Suttner of 1UP.com noted its understated strategic depth despite the game's faults. Game Informer reviewer Bryan Vore praised the game, calling it \"an extremely absorbing gameplay experience\". Vore further commended the variety of minigames and missions and noted how it prevented it from becoming a repetitive endeavor. GamePro's Cameron Lewis appreciated the depth of the gameplay, in particular on subtle markers and hidden objects which he deemed vital to progressing the game. Eurogamer reviewer Dave McCarthy praised the gameplay, calling it hypnotic and trance-like and not too complicated to control. Tracy Erickson of Pocket Gamer was pleased that the game wasn't likely to be completed in a single playthrough, noting it had many hours worth of gameplay. Despite the positive response to the gameplay, multiple reviewers also had criticism towards it. Luke Mitchell of PALGN and Hayes were disappointed in the lack of a pause option during missions. Vore found fault in the reliance of chance for weapon and army-upgrading material drops. Both Hayes and McCarthy made similar criticism for requiring to replay previous missions to obtain resources. X-Play reviewer Gus Mastrapa noted the gameplay can feel like a grind and also criticized the minigames for requiring up to three songs to obtain a specific item. In regards to the visual style, it was received with praise by multiple reviewers. Mitchell complimented the art design, calling it cute and comparing it to paper cut-outs. Lewis called the art style \"eye-catching\" and noted the Patapon tribe being full of personality. Hayes made similar comments, compared it to playing a cartoon and how expressive the Patapon tribes are. GameDaily reviewer Grant Holzhauer compared the art to the classic children's book, Where the Wild Things Are. Mastrapa praised the art style by calling it gorgeous, however, noted that it may be too cute for some. Erickson described the visuals as an impossibly stylish 2-D world with the Patapon tribe as unbearably cute. The music of Patapon was received positively by multiple reviews and described the game as \"catchy\". Multiple reviewers also noted the command for attack (Pon-Pon-Pata-Pon) and march (Pata-Pata-Pata-Pon) to be stuck in their head or be chanted after playing the game. Mitchell particularly praised the music changing when reaching Fever mode. Calvert gave the music a mixed reaction, stating that it's either going to be loved or hated. The game has sold 229,000 copies in North America by January 2009. Famitsu inducted into their Hall of Fame under their \"Platinum\" rank. GameSpot nominated it in their \"Best of 2008\" awards for \"Best Graphic, Artistic\", \"Best original game mechanic\", \"Best original IP\", \"Best Rhythm/Music game\", \"Best PSP game\" and won \"Best original music\" and \"Most innovative game\". IGN awarded the game for Best Music/Rhythm game, Best Artistic Design, Best Original Score, Best New IP, and PSP Game of the Year. Patapon was nominated at the 5th British Academy Games Awards for the Handheld category. During the 12th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences nominated Patapon for \" Hand-Held Game of the Year \" and \" Casual Game of the Year \". Patapon inspired two sequels for the PSP titled Patapon 2 and Patapon 3, becoming the first entry in a trilogy. Patapon 2 was released in Japan on November 27, 2008. It introduced new Patapon units, a customizable Hero character that can be used in multiplayer with a total of four players, and an evolution system to upgrade Patapons. Patapon 3 was released in Japan on April 28, 2011. In 2013, chinese developer Beijing Q&D created an unauthorized clone under the title PATAPON - Siege Of WOW! for iOS. A video game inspired by Patapon and Advance Wars titled Jungle Rumble: Freedom, Happiness, and Bananas was developed by indie developer Disco Pixel and released on May 1, 2014 for iOS and Android. A spiritual successor to the series known as Ratatan was announced by Ratata Arts and Tokyo Virtual Theory. Hiroyuki Kotani serves as director with Kemmei Adachi as director and game designer, Kemmei Adachi as composer, and Kazuto Sakajiri as producer. Initially unveiled at BitSummit 2023, a Kickstarter campaign for Ratatan went live on August 1, 2023 to support the project. The game is set to release in 2025."

        "text": "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is an upcoming skateboarding video game developed by Iron Galaxy and published by Activision. Similar to Vicarious Visions'predecessor Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2, it is a remake of Pro Skater 3 (2001) and Pro Skater 4 (2002), which were originally developed by Neversoft. It is scheduled to be released for the Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on July 11, 2025. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is a skateboarding video game played in a third-person view with its gameplay oriented towards classic arcade games. It uses the same mechanics as its predecessor 1 + 2, likewise, it also includes mechanics from all previous games up to Tony Hawk's Underground. The goal of most modes of the game is to achieve a high score or collect certain objects. The player must complete objectives to unlock levels to progress through the game. To score points, the player has to successfully perform and combine aerials, flips, grinds, lips, and manuals, with successful executions adding to the player's score. The point value of the trick is based on time maintained, degrees rotated, number of tricks performed in sequence, performing tricks on specific landmarks on the map, and the number of times the tricks have been used. Successful tricks add to the player's special meter, which, once full, allows for the execution of special tricks which are worth a great deal more than normal tricks. Bails (falling off the skateboard due to poor landing) attain no points for the attempted trick sequence and reset the special bar to empty. The game retains the core mechanics of the original titles, including trick-based skateboarding gameplay, score challenges, and level objectives. The career mode for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, which was open-ended in the original title, has been replaced with a two-minute run wherein the player must complete as many challenges as possible, similar to the first three titles in the series. The game features visual improvements such as 4K resolution support, enhanced textures, smoother animations, and improved lighting effects. Furthermore, it includes all original maps as well as new ones specifically made for the game. The soundtrack includes songs from the original games as well new songs. Online multiplayer supports cross-platform play for up to eight players. The Create-A-Skater mode allows for expanded customization options, while the Create-A-Park mode includes additional tools for designing custom skate parks. As of yet, the game includes a total of 26 professional skateboarders as well as several fictional characters. It features both classic and modern skaters, bringing back Tony Hawk, Bucky Lasek, and Rodney Mullen while introducing new pro skateboarders like Rayssa Leal, Margielyn Didal and Yuto Horigome. The Deluxe Edition features the Doom Slayer and a Revenant from the Doom franchise as bonus characters, while pre-ordering the game gives access to an exclusive style for Tony Hawk. Following the successful remake of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 by Vicarious Visions in 2020, Activision intended to continue with remakes of the third and fourth installments. However, in April 2022, Vicarious Visions was fully merged into Blizzard Entertainment, becoming Blizzard Albany, and shifted its focus exclusively to Blizzard's projects. Consequently, Activision entrusted the development of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 to Iron Galaxy. [ citation needed ] Activision teased the reveal of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 inside Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. During the game, players discovered hidden references and clues about the upcoming Tony Hawk's remake, leading to the setup of a countdown. This teaser strategy culminated in the official reveal on March 4, 2025. The release of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is scheduled for July 11, 2025, on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and Windows. It will also be available for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers at launch. Until release, dozens of trailers focusing on individual skaters or game versions were released. Besides the base game, the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game includes the Doom Slayer and a Revenant from Bethesda Softworks'Doom as playable characters as well as bonus songs and customization items. The Collector's Edition includes all bonus items from the Digital Deluxe release and a limited edition Birdhouse skateboard deck. Pre-ordering the game gives access to additional cosmetics as well as a special version of Tony Hawk as an exclusive skin. To further increase interest in the game, the soundtrack was released as a Spotify playlist in five waves starting in March, introducing new and old songs. Additionally, players who ordered the Digital Deluxe Edition received a exclusive rendition of \"At Doom's Gate\" from Doom in-game."

        "title": "Stronghold: Crusader",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stronghold_Crusader:_Definitive_Edition",
        "text": "Stronghold: Crusader is a 2002 real-time strategy video game developed by Firefly Studios and originally published by Gathering of Developers for Windows. It is a sequel to the 2001 video game Stronghold. Crusader has much in common with the original Stronghold, but differs from its predecessor in the fact that the game is no longer set in England, instead being set in the Middle East during the Crusades. Another prominent addition not found in its predecessor is a skirmish mode in single-player, allowing customized battles with AI opponents instead of the linear campaign. The game was also released as Stronghold Warchest. This version was a compendium of Stronghold and an enhanced version of Stronghold: Crusader, containing additional characters and an additional Crusader Trail. Stronghold Warchest was only released in a limited number of countries (e.g. USA or Poland), meaning players in the rest of the world have never encountered the second Crusader Trail, or second set of characters. This changed when an updated version of Stronghold Crusader, Stronghold: Crusader Extreme was released in early 2008. Stronghold: Crusader HD, a high-definition remake of the original, was released in 2012 by Firefly Studios. Both Stronghold: Crusader and Stronghold: Crusader Extreme are included in this edition. A remaster subtitled Definitive Edition is scheduled for release on Windows on 15 July 2025 by Firefly Studios, four years after Devolver Digital purchased the company. Stronghold Crusader features several real-time strategy campaign strings. These document the First and Third Crusade, as well as conflicts within the individual Crusader states. Each campaign comprises several battles, such as Nicaea, Heraclea, the siege of Antioch, Krak des Chevaliers, and the Siege of Jerusalem. The game also features the Crusader Trail, a series of 50 linked missions against various opponents. Stronghold Warchest adds one more Crusader Trail, consisting of 30 linked missions. The gameplay is similar to the original Stronghold, the major difference being that the game is set in the Middle East. As a consequence, farms can only be built on oasis grass, which leads to rivalry among players for limited farmland and resources. The game adds new AI opponents (the number depending on the version of the game) and several new Arabian units purchasable from a mercenary post. The colour of the player's units have also been changed from blue to red in order to match the colours of the Knights Templar. Other than farms there are other resources such as iron ore, quarry (for stone), and marshes (for oil). These resources are deposited on the stockpile and the player can choose to either sell or use them for defence purposes. There are two ways to build an army; either make the weapons and then spend a little gold to turn peasants into soldiers, or turn them directly into soldiers using more gold via the mercenary post. There are historical chapters (mostly fictionalized) which are to be completed using the resources given to the player at the start of the missions. Along with that there are 50 levels designed with increasing difficulty. In each level, the player must defend the kingdom and defeat one or more Kings. There is an option of three chickens at the start of the game which the player can use to skip a particular level. There are 30 additional levels added by the developers in the form of an additional Crusade Trail. The design of these mirrors the original 50 levels with the difficulty rising as the player progresses through the levels. The game contains several different characters that all appear as AI-controlled lords in the Skirmish mode, available to be selected as allies or enemies. One unique aspect of the game is that the characters have individual binks (small short videos) by which they communicate with the player, asking for goods or help if allied with them or, if they are the players'enemy, taunting them when attacking or expressing worry when under siege. These videos were absent for Stronghold 2 but returned in a new form for Stronghold Crusader II. In the base game, eight AI lords are available, including the opponents from the original game (The Rat, The Snake, The Pig, and The Wolf), as well as new Arabian, Kurdish and Crusader lords (Saladin, Richard the Lionheart, The Caliph, and The Sultan). With the Warchest edition, eight additional lords were added. Three of these (Emperor Frederick, King Philip, and The Sheriff) were made available by Firefly as a free download, but the five others - Nizar (based on the real-life Hassan-i Sabbah), The Emir, The Wazir, The Marshal (a repurposed Sir Longarm from the original Stronghold), and The Abbot - had to be obtained via buying the Warchest package. These additional lords were, however, properly included within the game's later release on Steam at no extra charge. The game received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. As Stronghold was a commercial success in the German market, local commentators suggested before Crusader's release that it would become a hit as well. The game opened as September's fifth-best-selling full-price computer game, according to Media Control. It maintained an unbroken streak in Media Control's top 30 for full-price games through June 2003, placing 20th that month. In August, it debuted in first place on the chart for budget-price games; by August 2004, it had spent 10 total months in the budget top 20. Crusader ultimately received a \"Gold\" certification from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD), indicating sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. According to Edge, Stronghold: Crusader sold at least 100,000 copies in the United States, but was beaten by the first Stronghold's 220,000 sales in the region. Total US sales of Stronghold games released during the 2000s reached 590,000 copies by August 2006. On 28 January 2008, Firefly Studios announced an expanded version of the game: Stronghold: Crusader Extreme. It boasts \"new AI opponents and maps\", a \"new crusader extreme trail\", \"battles featuring over 10,000 units\" and Windows Vista compatibility. It was released in June 2008. It also contains an updated version of the original Stronghold: Crusader, which includes everything except for outposts, the god powers and the Extreme Crusader Trail. However, if the official HD patch is installed, outposts can be built on maps on the original Stronghold Crusader part of Stronghold Crusader Extreme. The Extreme version received \"generally unfavorable reviews\" according to Metacritic. It was criticized for its extreme difficulty, lack of new audio, and not having graphical quality up to par for a game released in 2008. [ citation needed ] On 30 August 2012, Firefly Studios announced Stronghold Crusader II, a sequel to the original Crusader game. The company said that the game would be self-published, with additional funding to be sourced via crowd-funding site Gambitious. The game was released on 23 September 2014. In early 2025, Stronghold Crusader: Definitive Edition was announced by Firefly, with a release date for July of that year. Along with upgrading the graphics and tweaking the interface, other additions included new AI lords, new in-game units, larger map sizes, and additional cooperative options for multiplayer."

        "text": "Donkey Kong Bananza is an upcoming platform game published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch 2. The player controls the gorilla Donkey Kong as he seeks to recover stolen banana-shaped diamonds from a group of villainous apes. They explore sandbox -like levels while completing objectives, battling enemies, and collecting objects. Bananza features destructible environments; the player can destroy most terrain to create paths and find items. Bananza is the first major Donkey Kong game since Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze (2014) and the first 3D platformer since Donkey Kong 64 (1999). It is scheduled for release on July 17, 2025. Donkey Kong Bananza is a 3D platformer and action-adventure game that emphasizes destruction and open-world exploration. The story begins when VoidCo., a gang of villainous apes, steals Golden Bananas, banana-shaped diamonds, amidst a gold rush. The gorilla Donkey Kong, the player character, travels underground to recover them. He is accompanied by Odd Rock, an anthropomorphic purple stone who directs him towards objectives. The player explores sandbox -like levels in the underground world. Donkey Kong can roll, punch, slap the terrain, pick up and throw objects, and climb most surfaces. Journalists have compared Bananza to Super Mario Odyssey (2017), some describing it as a successor. The player completes missions, solves puzzles, and fights enemies to collect Golden Bananas. Golden Bananas function similarly to Odyssey's Power Moons and are obtained by progressing through the story or found through exploration. The player can receive advice from, assist, and obtain Golden Bananas from non-player characters (NPCs), including other Donkey Kong characters such as Cranky Kong. Bananza is distinguished by its destructible environments: Donkey Kong can smash almost every surface and destroy terrain. He can rip pieces of the environment from the ground or walls and throw them to uncover items or destroy enemies, or use them as snowboards. Destroying environments allows for varied traversal; for instance, Donkey Kong can dig underground and create a path to another area of the world. He can also uncover Golden Bananas by digging. The extent to which the player can destroy the environment is limited by a layer of unbreakable bedrock at the bottom of each level. The player keeps track of their progress in a 3D world map. Other collectibles include Banandium, a gold-like material that serves as currency, and fossils, which the player can trade. While exploring, the player discovers secluded areas where they must complete challenges including platforming, solving puzzles, defeating enemies within a time limit, and mining for Banandium. They are rewarded Golden Bananas or Banandium upon completion. Some areas contain side-scrolling sections, similar to the Donkey Kong Country games, and minecarts. The previous major Donkey Kong game, Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, was released for the Wii U in 2014. Afterwards, Nintendo and Vicarious Visions, with consultation from the franchise's creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, worked on a Donkey Kong game for the Nintendo Switch for six months. Codenamed Freedom, the project was an open-world 3D platformer that emphasized traversal, with grinding on vines as a core mechanic. It was canceled in 2016 after Activision Blizzard, Vicarious Visions'parent company, redirected its developers'focus to the Call of Duty franchise. In 2021, Nintendo Life reported that Nintendo Entertainment Planning & Development was developing the next Donkey Kong game, the first developed internally since Donkey Kong Jungle Beat (2004). Development reportedly began in 2017 or 2018. Bananza is the first 3D Donkey Kong platformer since Donkey Kong 64 (1999). It is the first Donkey Kong game to use a redesigned Donkey Kong since Rare's Donkey Kong Country (1994), similar to his appearance in The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023). Kouichi Kawamoto, who led the Nintendo Switch 2's development, cited Bananza's destructible environments as an example of gameplay made possible by the improved processing speed over the original Switch. Nintendo announced Donkey Kong Bananza in a Nintendo Direct presentation on April 2, 2025. It is scheduled for release for the Nintendo Switch 2 on July 17. It will be the first major Donkey Kong game since Tropical Freeze."

        "title": "Shadow Labyrinth",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Labyrinth",
        "text": "Shadow Labyrinth is an upcoming action-adventure video game developed by Bandai Namco Studios and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. It is part of the Pac-Man series, serving as a re-imagining of the franchise's core concepts. The player will take on the role of \"The Swordsman\" while traversing through a large \"maze\", fighting against enemies and upgrading their abilities as they progress; initial reactions upon the game's announcement widely considered it to be a metroidvania game. The game was initially promoted by the release of the Secret Level episode \"Circle\", which serves as an official prequel to the game. Shadow Labyrinth is set to be released on July 18, 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC via Steam. Shadow Labyrinth will be a 2D action-adventure game. The game's player character will be a figure known as \"The Swordsman\", as he is guided around a giant \"maze\" by an orb known as \" Puck \". Throughout the game, the player will explore the \"maze\" while fighting against monsters. The player will also be able to acquire new abilities and items. Several journalists upon its announcement considered the game to be a metroidvania. Bandai Namco Studios began developing Shadow Labyrinth in 2020. When conceptualizing the game, they made expanding the audience of the Pac-Man series, which is a predominantly family friendly franchise, their primary goal. They decided to do this by creating a more \"dark\" entry in the series. They went back to the original concepts for the first Pac-Man game, and boiled it down to \"the maze concept, the eat concept, and how the table can flip all of a sudden\". Using that basis, the team began creating Shadow Labyrinth. The game's development team is joined by Katsuhiro Harada, the producer of the Tekken series. It is being developed using the Unity engine. Per the development team's vision behind expanding the appeal of Pac-Man to those who had never played a game in the series, they chose to leave any references to it out of the game's title. The darker setting and art direction behind Shadow Labyrinth is based on what the development team described as the \"Ice Age\" concept. In an interview with Rolling Stone, marketing manager Knoah Piasek said that this concept referred to the idea of the game's enemies and bosses being monsters that were native to the planet it takes place on, rather than basic enemy designs that the series was known for like ghosts. Furthermore, Piasek said that alongside the enemies that originated from the planet, some will have also fused with beings from other worlds, allowing the game's enemies to develop into something \"bigger and scarier\". During the development of Shadow Labyrinth, an episode of Secret Level was created to serve as a prequel to the game and help promote it. The episode, titled \"Circle\", follows a \"Swordsman\" as he explores a wasteland while accompanied by \"Puck\", the latter of whom eventually fuses with the former to become a monstrous version of Pac-Man. The swordsman in the episode is referred to officially as \"Swordsman No. 7\", while the player character in Shadow Labyrinth is referred to as \"Swordsman No. 8\". During development of that episode, series creator Tim Miller was shown a sneak peek of the game and commented on its differences from a traditional Pac-Man game. The game was formally revealed at The Game Awards 2024, and its release date was revealed during a Nintendo Direct in March 2025. It is set to be released on July 18, 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam. It will also be released on Nintendo Switch 2 that same day. The game will be a part of the 45th anniversary celebration of the original Pac-Man game. The game's producer Seigo Aizawa commented that the theme of the 45th anniversary celebration was \"making an impact\", and stated that releasing a game like Shadow Labyrinth that was the \"antithesis\" to previous games in the series was their way to following that theme. The game is also not planned to have any post-launch downloadable content, with Aizawa stating that the game will be \"completed in one package\"."

        "title": "Azure Striker Gunvolt",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azure_Striker_Gunvolt",
        "text": "Azure Striker Gunvolt, known as Armed Blue: Gunvolt in Japan, is a 2D side-scrolling action - platform game developed and published by Inti Creates. It was first released for Nintendo 3DS via eShop in August 2014. Ports of the game were released for Windows in 2015, for Nintendo Switch in 2017, for PlayStation 4 in 2020, and for Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S in 2022. In addition to utilizing gameplay similar to Mega Man Zero, Azure Striker Gunvolt also introduced new gameplay elements such as Gunvolt's ability to \"tag\" enemies and target many at once, adding an additional layer of complexity to the genre. Set in a futuristic world in which beings known as ‚Äúadepts‚Äù coexist with humanity, the game follows a powerful adept named Gunvolt, who upon following a botched assassin attempt, leaves the organization that he works for to become a freelance agent. Across the game, Gunvolt attempts to use his adept powers to dismantle the Sumeragi Group, a peace-keeping cooperation who in turn, is secretly responsible for abusing countless adepts. Mighty Gunvolt, a crossover with Mighty No. 9 and Gal Gun, was released on the same day as Azure Striker Gunvolt. It was followed by a sequel, Mighty Gunvolt Burst, in 2017. A direct sequel, Azure Striker Gunvolt 2, was released in 2016. A spin-off centered on character Copen, Gunvolt Chronicles: Luminous Avenger iX, was released in 2019 and received its own sequel, Gunvolt Chronicles: Luminous Avenger iX 2, in 2022. The latest installment, Azure Striker Gunvolt 3, was released for Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 and PC in 2022. Like the Mega Man series, namely the original series, Mega Man X, Mega Man Zero and Mega Man ZX, Azure Striker Gunvolt is a side-scrolling action platform game. The player controls the eponymous Gunvolt, who is able to jump, dash, and utilize a gun with special bullets that \"tag\" their targets, which grants a homing effect to Gunvolt's electric fields. Hitting an enemy with multiple tags will guide more of Gunvolt's electricity towards that enemy, increasing damage. The player's actions are limited by an energy bar, which depletes when using the electrical field, using additional movement abilities such as double-jumping or air dashing, or being hit by enemies. Whenever the energy bar is depleted, Gunvolt will enter an \"Overheat\" state and will be unable to use his septimal powers or defend himself until it refills. Gameplay focuses heavily on the player's technique and skill in moving through stages. While finishing a stage is relatively easy, the game provides a ranking system as well as several optional challenges. The game introduces a \"chain\" system in which the player's score is constantly increased so long as the player avoids being hit by enemies, with special actions such as defeating an enemy in the air or defeating multiple enemies at one time providing an additional bonus. [ citation needed ] The game uses an item-forging and equipping system, the former of which is instrumental in achieving the game's true ending. Additionally, Gunvolt has access to several super move-like skills called Offensive Skills, which allow him to perform powerful attacks or heal himself. Each of the game's bosses also have their own Offensive Skills, which are triggered when their health bar drops below a certain level, or in the case of Elise, one of the bosses, when one of her halves is killed before the other. Speaking to Joule in Gunvolt's apartment in between stages also increases the chance of being brought back to life by Lumen when he dies in a stage, which gives Gunvolt unlimited Septimal energy, but at the cost of a higher stage ranking. Gunvolt can also level-up when he gains a certain amount of experience from defeating certain enemies. Azure Striker Gunvolt is set during an unspecified date in the near future, in which several people called \"adepts\" have developed \"septimal powers\". These powers enable superhuman feats including flight, the use of powerful energy weapons, and manipulation of the elements like fire, water, and electricity. The world is at peace thanks to the efforts of a world-spanning corporation known as the Sumeragi Group. However, the Sumeragi Group is, in reality, controlling and experimenting on adepts. Gunvolt, one of the most powerful adepts, has the ability to create electrical fields and works for an organization known as QUILL, which is seeking to reveal and put a stop to Sumeragi's ulterior motives. The game opens with Gunvolt assigned on a mission to assassinate an adept named Lumen. He is told that Lumen has the ability to resonate with and control any adepts through her singing, and is considered dangerous. However, Gunvolt discovers that Lumen is the septimal projection of a young girl named Joule, who is a captive of Sumeragi's scientists, and can't bring himself to kill her. He instead rescues her, leading him to amicably defect from QUILL and set out on his own to protect her. He becomes a freelance agent, but still works jobs for QUILL from time to time. Six months after defecting from QUILL, Gunvolt is offered a freelance assignment by Moniqa, his handler from QUILL, to investigate and take out several agents of the Sumeragi Group. The Sumeragi agents are all adepts as well, but powered by strange Glaives, which house their septimal essences, and are representative of each of the Seven Deadly Sins. The first agent, Merak, is a lazy, unenthusiastic adept with the power to bend space for use in his attacks. The second, Jota, is a prideful agent with the power to manipulate light. The third, Viper, is loud, brash, and violent, has control over fire, and harbors a jealous rage against Gunvolt for Joule. The fourth, Carerra, uses magnetic fists and waves to draw his enemies close before destroying them with a powerful pulsewave. The fifth, Elise, is a split personality adept: her meek, timid side and her brash, assertive side are at constant odds, but her ability to raise the dead allows for even adepts to come back from defeat. The sixth, Stratos, is a drug-addicted adept with an insatiable hunger for the very drug that keeps what little of his sanity remains in check, and has control over swarms of insects. The seventh, the carnal Zonda, attacks and wounds Zeno, one of Gunvolt's friends from QUILL, but is seemingly killed by a human warrior named Copen, who harbors a major hatred for adepts and carries a gun capable of firing bullets that can suppress their powers. Copen warns Gunvolt that they are not on the same side, and after a brief skirmish, retreats. After defeating the Sumeragi agents, Gunvolt's apartment is invaded, and Joule is kidnapped by a resurrected Merak. Gunvolt gives chase, destroying Merak for good, and rides a space elevator to a Sumeragi orbiting platform. Along the way, he encounters the resurrected Stratos, Jota, and Viper and fights them all to the death, before finding that Elise herself had a hidden feral and wild third personality; responsible for the resurrection of the agents. This third personality is killed by Copen, and Gunvolt is forced to fight and subdue him. Gunvolt finally encounters the leadership of Sumeragi, a young psychic adept named Nova. He uses Lumen in combat against Gunvolt, before summoning Joule and three Glaives into himself to transform into a monstrous beast. Gunvolt manages to kill Nova and escape with Joule. In the initial ending, Gunvolt runs into Asimov, his father figure and the leader of QUILL, who offers Gunvolt and Joule new places in QUILL, and reveals an ulterior motive: with Sumeragi in shambles, Asimov wishes to use Lumen, along with the Sumeragi satellite, to wipe out the human race as payback for suppression of adepts. Gunvolt refuses his offer, telling Asimov that he is no better than Sumeragi was, and Asimov responds by shooting him through the heart using Copen's gun (implying that he defeated Copen to steal it from him), before turning the gun on Joule and shooting her as well, leaving them both for dead. However, if Gunvolt is wearing a special pendant Joule made for him, which is made of collectable jewels that are hidden within each stage, this ending will be revealed as a dream and the true ending will occur instead. The true ending sees Gunvolt on the verge of death as in the initial ending, but he is then rescued by Lumen at the last minute. He awakens to find Joule's body, deathly cold and still. Heartbroken, Gunvolt screams in sadness until he hears Lumen's voice, and ultimately realizes that, in an act of love in order to save his life and be with him wherever he goes, Joule forsook her physical form by fusing her mind and personality with Lumen before further fusing herself into Gunvolt's septimal energy, which amplifies Gunvolt's power to its utmost limits. After this revelation, Gunvolt chases down Asimov, running into Carrera along the way. Carrera demands vengeance for his prior defeat, but is killed once and for all by Gunvolt. Continuing onward to the elevator, Gunvolt confronts Asimov, who reveals himself to have the same electrical septimal powers as Gunvolt. With no other choice, Gunvolt fights him to the death. Following this final battle, Asimov warns Gunvolt that he will never be truly free of conflicts in his life, and dies from his wounds. Zeno and Moniqa meet the space elevator as it arrives, only to find Asimov dead and a heartbroken, wounded Gunvolt, who offers no explanation as to what happened before he simply wanders away into the morning light to be alone with Joule. Azure Striker Gunvolt was developed by Inti Creates, the Japanese video game development company that also created the Mega Man Zero series, Mega Man ZX, and both Mega Man 9 and Mega Man 10. Players who purchased the game upon release received a free download for the spin-off game, Mighty Gunvolt. Inti Creates later released an update for the game on March 5, 2015 on the Nintendo eShop. The update fixes typos in the game's dialogue, fixes various glitches, adds the ability to transfer save data from the demo version to the purchased version, adds new features exclusive to the New Nintendo 3DS, and more new/updated content. A version for Windows was released in August 2015. A physical release, titled Azure Striker Gunvolt: Striker Pack, consisting of both Azure Striker Gunvolt and its sequel, Azure Striker Gunvolt 2, was released on September 30, 2016 in Japan. Yacht Club Games released it in North America on October 4, 2016. Azure Striker Gunvolt: Striker Pack was released for Nintendo Switch in August 2017, and PlayStation 4 on April 23, 2020. An update for the eShop release of the first game added in the voiceovers from the Striker Pack and used the newer translation from the Steam release. However, neither of these have made it anywhere else in the world, and Inti Creates has yet to comment on this issue. [ citation needed ] A standalone port for Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S was announced and released on June 29, 2022. Azure Striker Gunvolt received \"generally favorable\" reviews and sold over 90,000 units six months after its release, being praised for its art and gameplay, although it has experienced some criticism of its similarities in plot to the Mega Man series. Inti Creates later announced that Azure Striker Gunvolt had sold 100,000 units by March 2015. In March 2016, Inti Creates announced that Azure Striker Gunvolt had sold over 150,000 units worldwide and aired a presentation regarding its sequel on April 26, 2016.

Gunvolt Chronicles: Luminous Avenger iX 2 was released for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Windows on January 27, 2022. Copen also appeared as a playable DLC character in the game COGEN: Sword of Rewind by developer Gemdrops, which released on the same date as Luminous Avenger iX 2. Mighty Gunvolt, a retro-style shooter featuring characters from Gunvolt and Mighty No. 9, was released in 2014, followed by a sequel, Mighty Gunvolt Burst, in 2017. Gunvolt also appears as a playable guest character in several titles, including Runbow, Blaster Master Zero, Indie Pogo, and Blade Strangers. An original video anime adaptation was announced by Inti Creates at the Anime Expo 2016 convention in Los Angeles, California on July 3, 2016. The series was directed and produced by Yoshinori Odaka, with animation by LandQ Studios, scripts written by Shigeru Murakoshi, and character designs by Masakazu Sunagawa. It was planned for a 2016 release, but it was delayed to 2017, eventually being released worldwide on the Nintendo eShop on February 9, 2017, along with an English dubbed version. Peter von Gomm did the English dub of the character Copen."

        "title": "Cotton: Fantastic Night Dreams",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_Reboot!",
        "text": "Cotton: Fantastic Night Dreams is a scrolling shooter video game developed by Success and originally released in Japanese arcades in 1991. The first installment in the Cotton series, players assume the role of the young witch Cotton who, alongside her fairy companion Silk, sets out on her broomstick on a quest to defeat several monsters and get her Willow candy. Its gameplay mainly consists of shooting mixed with role-playing game elements using a main two-button configuration. It ran on the Sega System 16 hardware. First launched in arcades, it was later ported to multiple platforms, each one featuring several changes or additions compared with the original version. Cotton proved to be popular among players in Japanese arcades, earning several awards from Gamest magazine, however the console ports have been met with mixed reception from critics. It is regarded as a key title in the \" cute'em up \" sub-genre. On November 28, 2024, the arcade version of the game got ported as part of the Arcade Archives series. Cotton: Fantastic Night Dreams is a scrolling shooter game reminiscent of Parodius where players assume the role of a young witch named Cotton who, alongside her fairy companion Silk, travels various increasingly difficult levels through a fantasy dream-like world on a quest to defeat several monsters and get her Willow candy. Players must blast various monsters and avoid being shot while collecting crystal power-ups to enhance Cotton's firepower and unleash powerful magic spells on enemies, in addition of bombs capable of obliterating enemies. The game incorporates some role playing game elements, as players are able to level up their attack up to 13 levels. The player has lives represented by an arrow and three lives, though only one hit is allowed per life and the game is over once all lives are lost, unless more credits are inserted into the arcade machine to continue playing. Cotton: Fantastic Night Dreams was first published by Sega in the arcades for the Sega System 16 arcade board in April 1991, and was showcased to attendees at the 1991 AOU Show after launch. It was produced by Success founder Takato Yoshinari. Masaru Hatsuyama and Toshiyuki Kuwabara acted as co-programmers. Hideki Tamura, known for being an anime animator, served as character designer. Tamura was also responsible for the pixel art as co-graphic designer along with artist Shinobu It≈ç, prior to her role on the unreleased party game QP for Neo Geo, and T. Kashima. The music was composed by Kenichi Hirata, while Cotton was voiced by radio actress Takae Yoriguchi. Tamura remarked that he quit the anime industry prior to working on the project, being his first job in a video game development position, and as such, was memorable to him in how it taught him how game development worked. Tamura recalled that the game went under the working title Kurumi-zaka Diary: Katsugeki-Hen early in development, but forced the team to change the name to Cotton and change the story to one that made little sense later on. It made use of hand-drawn animations, which was uncommon for an arcade game at the time. Cotton was ported to the TurboGrafx-16, first being published in Japan by Hudson Soft on 12 February 1993 and later in North America by Turbo Technologies Inc. in April 1993. This version runs on the Super CD-ROM¬≤ expansion featuring a lower screen resolution, a modified color palette, and CD-quality audio. The Japanese version also includes voice acting, with Cotton being voiced by Tarako. The game later received a conversion to the Sharp X68000 home computer with many changes and enhancements over the arcade version, published only in Japan by Electronic Arts Victor on 24 September 1993. The title was then ported in near arcade-perfect form to the PlayStation in Japan under the name Cotton Original on 28 April 1999 and later reissued on 30 March 2000 under the \"SuperLite 1500\" budget series. Cotton Original was later re-released through PlayStation Network on 28 June 2007. It was also ported to the Neo Geo Pocket Color, first being published in Japan by Success on 23 March 2000, and later in Europe by SNK the same year. Due to hardware limitations, the Neo Geo Pocket Color release features less detailed graphics and inferior sound quality compared to previous versions. This version has since become an expensive collector's item. In 2007, the game was released for mobile phones in Japan, with 50 Cotton -themed teacups being given away in a lottery and a competition to commemorate the release. A Mega-CD port was planned but never released. In 2019, a new version based on the X68000 port titled Cotton Reboot! was announced by Japanese retailer BEEP and scheduled for release on Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4. Developed by Rocket-Engine, this version is presented in a 16:9 aspect ratio, adds an extra arrange mode for newcomers and features a faithful recreation of the X68000 version. The arranged mode also features new voice work based on a cast selected by auditioning, with Minami Miyaki now playing the role of Cotton. The PlayStation 4 and Switch versions were made available on February 25, 2021, as both physical and downloadable releases, while the Windows version was released on November 11, 2021, via Steam. Additionally, BEEP re-released the original X68000 port. In 2020, ININ Games announced that Cotton Reboot! would be released in western regions both physically and digitally for Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 on July 20, 2021. In December 2020, the original arcade version was re-released as part of the Sega Astro City Mini console. An update to Cotton Reboot! was announced in April 2021, featuring Appli ke Pumpkin and her hat companion Needle from Cotton 2: Magical Night Dreams as free playable characters, as well as improving screen visibility and bug fixes. Both Appli and Neddle are voiced by Hyo-sei and Yoshinori Ishikawa respectively. On November 28, 2024, the arcade version of the game was ported to the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch by Hamster Corporation as part of the Arcade Archives series. Cotton garnered positive reception from seven reviewers of Gamest during its 1991 AOU Show appearance. In Japan, Game Machine listed the game on their 1 June 1991 issue as being the ninth most-popular arcade game during the previous two weeks. In the July 1991 issue of Japanese publication Micom BASIC Magazine, the game was ranked on the number sixteenth spot in popularity. Gamest also gave it several awards for the 5th Gamest Grand Prize. Cotton won 4th place in the Best Shooting Award, 4th place in the Best Direction Award, 4th place in the Best VGM Award, and the character of Cotton won 2nd place in Character Awards for best character. The TurboGrafx-CD port received positive reception from critics. Public reception was also positive: readers of PC Engine Fan voted to give Cotton a 22.82 out of 30 score, ranking at the number 101 spot in a poll, indicating a popular following. French magazine Consoles + praised its arcade-accurate graphics, animations, hard rock soundtrack, playability and replay value but criticized the presentation. Electric Brain compared the game with Parodius while noting its difficulty level, regarding it to be an above average shoot'em up. They gave positive remarks to the colorful presentation, Valis -like orchestral music and sound effects but criticized the irritating Japanese voicework during story cutscenes. GameFan regarded the port to be one of the better shooter games for the TurboGrafx-CD, commenting positively in regards to its originality, fast action, audiovisual presentation and challenging stages. DuoWorld criticized the TurboGrafx-CD's English translation of cutscenes for being incoherent and Cotton's fairy companion to be less useful than the drones in R-Type and Blazing Lazers. They drew comparisons to Magical Chase in terms of its poor graphics, enemy variety, and sound design. However, they praised the presentation and gameplay. Computer and Video Games commended the visuals, sound and gameplay. In 2008, IGN placed both Cotton and Magical Chase as number 4 on the top ten list of TurboGrafx titles not released on the Virtual Console, stating that both games were different but shared the same general idea. Japanese magazine Oh!X gave the original X68000 port a positive review. The port also proved popular among the X68000 userbase in Japan, which would eventually led it in being nominated for a \"Game of the Year\" award from Oh!X but lost against other titles. Cotton Original on PlayStation was met with mixed reception from reviewers. Famitsu was critical of the game, saying that after eight years it was showing its age. Gamers'Republic called the PlayStation port \"antiquated\", as well as \"lifeless\" and \"insufferably monotonous\". They recommended playing games like Radiant Silvergun or R-Type Delta to understand the gap in quality between those games and Cotton. GameFan however, praised the PlayStation version, saying that it is still worth checking out despite the slowdown issue. The Neo Geo Pocket Color conversion was also met with mixed reception. Pockett Videogames commended its use of the handheld's color palette, animations and music but criticized certain aspects such as the sound effects. In 2023, Time Extension identified Cotton as one of the best games for the NGPC. Cotton Reboot! received \"generally favorable reviews\" on Nintendo Switch and \"mixed or average reviews\" on PlayStation 4, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Famitsu reported that the Switch version of Reboot! sold over 2,894 copies in its first week on the market. Famitsu's four reviewers praised the game's arranged version for being easy to play, \"Jewel Fever\" mechanic, flashy visuals, addition of a timed score attack mode and faithful recreation of the X68000 conversion. Nintendo Life's Tom Massey also commended the addition of arranged mode, stating that it plays like a new game, inclusion of the X68000 version and online leaderboards but criticized the amount of visual distraction when playing arranged mode and technical issues when playing the X68000 port. Hardcore Gamer's Jeremy Peeples called it a fantastic reimagining of the original game, giving positive remarks to the remade presentation, immersive environments, ability to switch between the original and arranged soundtracks, and forgiving game design but criticized issues with blind spots. Destructoid's Chris Moyse noted that the core gameplay and scoring mechanic were complex and deep respectively. Moyse gave positive commentary when it came to the colorful and flashy visuals. However, he also criticized this aspect due to being distracting and noted the lack of additional content in the package. TouchArcade's Shaun Musgrave commented that the amount of objects filling the screen could turn the playfield busy at certain times. Nevertheless, Musgrave noted that it was enjoyable following the plot and replay value due to the multiple game modes, difficulty levels and unlockable character. Push Square's Jamie O'Neill praised the game for its two-dimensional graphics, arranged soundtrack, elaborate mechanics and scoring system, inclusion of the X68000 port and accessibility but criticized it for being single-player only, as well as the lack of save states and English voiceovers. Siliconera's Joel Couture commended Reboot! for its impressive HD visual style, remixed soundtrack, mechanically complex gameplay and addition of the X68000 version, claiming each modes brings different playstyles that makes them feel like separate games. Pure Nintendo Magazine's Kirk Hiner stated that \"If you‚Äôve never heard of Cotton: Fantastic Night Dreams, that‚Äôs no reason to ignore Cotton Reboot! You need not be a retro gamer to appreciate this shoot ‚Äôem up‚Äôs excellent arcade/action gameplay, you just need to be a fan of cute, upbeat fun.\" Cotton: Fantastic Night Dreams spawned several sequels and follow-ups. Retro Gamer regarded Cotton to be one of the key games in the \" cute'em up \" sub-genre alongside Parodius, Fantasy Zone, TwinBee and Harmful Park. In a 2018 interview with 4Gamer.net, designer Yoshiyasu Matsushita stated that Cotton was an influence during development of Twinkle Star Sprites. Cotton: Fantastic Night Dreams got ported for home consoles as part of the Arcade Archives series in November, 2024, by HAMSTER Corporation for the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch."

        "text": "La storia della Arcana Famiglia („Ç¢„É´„Ç´„Éä„Éª„Éï„Ç°„Éü„É™„Ç¢, Arukana Famiria, Italian for \"The Story of the Arcane Family\") is a Japanese visual novel made by HuneX and Comfort. The first game was released on October 27, 2011, for the PlayStation Portable (PSP). A fan disc also for the PSP titled Arcana Famiglia -Vascello Phantasma no Majutsushi- („Ç¢„É´„Ç´„Éä„Éª„Éï„Ç°„Éü„É™„Ç¢ -ÂπΩÈúäËàπÔºà„É¥„Ç°„Çπ„ÉÅ„Çß„É≠„Éª„Éï„Ç°„É≥„Çø„Ç∫„ÉûÔºâ„ÅÆÈ≠îË°ìÂ∏´-, lit., \"Arcana Famiglia -The Phantom Ship Magician-\") was released on June 21, 2012, featuring two new characters: Ash and Joshua. A spin-off cooking game titled Arcana Famiglia -Festa Regalo!- („Ç¢„É´„Ç´„Éä„Éª„Éï„Ç°„Éü„É™„Ç¢ „Éï„Çß„Çπ„Çø„Éª„É¨„Ç¨„Éº„É≠, lit., \"Arcana Famiglia -Holiday Gift!-\") was released on December 13, 2012. The first game has been adapted into a manga and anime series along with various franchise-related merchandise such as drama CDs, music CDs, and fanbooks, etc. There is an organization called the Arcana Famiglia, which protects the island of Regalo (Italian for \"gift\" or \"present\"). The Famiglia is made up of people who have made contracts with Arcana cards, and have received special abilities due to this. On his birthday celebration, Mondo has decided it is time for him to retire and give up his title to a new boss who has control over an Arcana. To decide who in the \"family\" gets this title, he calls for a tournament, called the Arcana Duello, between Arcana users. To the winner, he promises the title of \"Papa\", a wish of the winner's choice and his daughter's hand in marriage. Refusing to accept this, Felicit√† decides to fight to choose her own path, with Libert√† and Nova fighting for her freedom by her side. A manga based on the game, titled Arcana Famiglia: Amore Mangiare Cantare!, began publishing in the comic magazine Sylph in 2011. The manga features art by Ruru (Artist). An anime adaptation produced by J.C.Staff began airing in July 2012. The anime is licensed by Sentai Filmworks in North America. The series originally aired from July 1, 2012, to September 16, 2012; with direction by Chiaki Kon, character design by Mai Matsuura and art direction by Takahiro Yokeda. The anime series follows Felicit√†, the only daughter of Mondo, the soon-to-be-retired boss of the mafia organization Arcana Famiglia. Mondo creates a tournament among the Arcana users to determine the new heir to the organization. However, as Felicit√† unfortunately learns that the prize of the tournament includes her to be betrothed to the winner, she decides to join this tournament herself and choose her own path, receiving support from Libert√† and Nova to achieve her goal. The opening song for the anime was \"Magenta Another Sky\" by Hitomi Harada, while the ending was \"Pieces of Treasure\" by Jun Fukuyama and Tsubasa Yonaga, who voice Libert√† and Nova respectively. From the second to seventh episode, one of Arcana Famiglia members is forced to do something as punishment for breaking a rule of the mansion. Felicit√† remembers when she was first welcomed into the organization and respected by the members, but is soon reminded about the upcoming Arcana Duello. Later, Felicit√† and Libert√† help Nova find a stray white kitten that has been wandering inside the mansion, though it was quite a struggle just to catch it. As they search for the owner of the kitten, they seek help from Debito, who narrows down the list of women due to the ribbon around the kitten's neck and its scent. After Felicit√† is able to read the kitten's heart using The Lovers and see the face of its owner, a blonde woman wearing a fancy blue dress, the three are directed to a dress store owned by the woman named Federica. As a token of her appreciation, Federica gives Felicit√† a white frilly dress. On the way home, Libert√† and Nova tell Felicit√† that she should learn to control The Lovers and should not randomly read the hearts of others. This gives Felicit√† the determination to win the Arcana Duello herself. Nova tells Felicit√† and Libert√† that the housemaid Isabella saw a ghost earlier in the kitchen, but it is later learned that Luca used a white cloth and broom to scare Pace, who ate the entire first batch of baked sweets while sleepwalking. The baked sweets are for the Piccolino, an annual event held at the church to entertain children. After Luca performs a boring magic trick, Debito tells the children a scary story as a joke, in which an orphan was killed by a demon and its ghost still haunts the church. Luca and Pace recall when they would play with Debito inside the church when they were all kids. After lunch, Pace and Debito play soccer with the children, but end up hurting Luca in the process. Meanwhile, Sumire convinces Nova to participate in the Piccolino this year, despite the fact that Nova has trouble kindly interacting with children. As the children retreat inside the church due to a storm, they are all eventually escorted to their homes. After Debito escorts the last two children who were left with Felicit√† and Libert√†, Nova arrives and catches sight of a child who was left behind named Elmo. Libert√† retrieves a blanket for Elmo, but the latter chooses to leave the church instead, despite Nova's plea. Elmo is nowhere to be found when Nova chases after him to the outside. Felicit√† and Libert√† are tasked by Surmire to deliver a scarf to a woman named Jovanna, who gave a brooch to Sumire in the past. However, due to the sudden recollections of his past with Dante, Libert√† becomes disturbed to the point where he and Felicit√† accidentally fall off a roof and destroy a shop. Having to spend the rest of the day working for the shop owner, Felicit√† and Libert√† luckily run into Jovanna and give her the scarf. When Libert√† discovers a familiar mask in the shop, he suddenly remembers that a masked man saved him from an orphanage. Later, Felicit√† accidentally looks into Dante's heart and sees a fragment of Libert√†'s past. She consults Dante, who reveals that it was ten years ago when he was indeed the masked man who came to the orphanage, where experiments were conducted, to save Libert√†, who inadvertently set it on fire by wishing for it to happen. In response, Dante sealed away Libert√†'s memories using The Emperor, which caused him to be bald, while Mondo sealed away Libert√†'s Arcana power, The Fool. After Libert√† storms off when Felicit√† declines his request to read his heart, Dante tells Libert√† that his memories are still sealed because he is not strong enough to accept his past just yet. Nova then tells Libert√† to become stronger. When lemon meringue pie is served at the dining table, Libert√† leaves in the middle of eating. Nova confronts Libert√†, saying that Felicit√† has nothing to do with his issue with Dante. After helping Felicit√† deliver some lemon meringue pies to Sumire, Nova recalls his first time meeting Mondo and Sumire when he was younger, in which he was chosen to marry his cousin Felicit√† when he becomes older. Later, Felicit√† and Nova manage to catch some thieves while patrolling the town, returning the wallet back to a woman. Nova tells Felicit√† that she is destined to become the heir to the Arcana Famiglia, even though she assumes that people do not expect much from her. Nova has a dream about his parents wanting to gain control of the Arcana Famiglia when he becomes betrothed to Felicit√†. Luca later scolds Nova for being too cold towards Felicit√†, suggesting that he should be nice to her. Suspicious about an unequal distribution of funds to the research division, Nova sends Felicit√† to investigate upon the matter. However, on the way there, she encounters Jolly, who changed the lock on the door to the facility and is surprisingly aware of the suspicion. He hands her a stack of documents before she leaves, but she does not know that he is keeping a cylindrical tank with a floating object inside hidden behind a curtain. When Felicit√† returns to Nova with the documents, Nova stumbles upon his parents'clinical charts. Felicit√† is shocked when Nova reveals that he put his parents into a deep sleep using his Arcana power, Death, in order to protect Mondo and Sumire from being killed. Seeing that she grew up with a loving family unlike his, Nova tells Felicit√† to leave him alone for now. Jolly informs the other members that Nova's father Moreno has been kidnapped by pirates on a ship, but tells them to sit back until instructed otherwise. However, Felicit√†, Libert√† and Nova eventually agree to rescue Moreno instead. As the three go to the harbor and enter the ship, they are soon surrounded by the pirates in the main deck. After using Death to put the pirates into a deep sleep, Nova advises Felicit√† and Libert√† to find Moreno before he becomes unconscious and the effect of Death wears off. As Felicit√† and Libert√† later return to Nova with Moreno in tow, they encounter a masked pirate on the upper deck. Both Felicit√† and Libert√† take on the masked pirate together, and Libert√† manages to kick the masked pirate into the main mask. However, as the main mast cracks and leans toward Felicit√†, Libert√† remembers how to use The Fool and causes the mast to shatter. Libert√† passes out and Felicit√† is knocked out by the masked pirate, who is revealed to be Dante after his mask cracks, with the pirates as his crew. Dante planned out this entire scheme to help Felicit√†, Libert√† and Nova become stronger in time before the Arcana Duello. The three later wake up in the mansion's underground cellar, where Jolly shuns them for disobeying orders, aside from the fact that Moreno is now safe. After Jolly leaves stating that their Arcana powers were possibly tested, the three wonder how Jolly was aware of what happened on the ship. Libert√† and Nova are to personally deliver a letter from Sumire to Felicit√†, but with no luck of finding her in town. Instead, Libert√† and Nova come across a girl who fled from Debito's casino, but Libert√† and Nova end up handcuffed together rather than handcuffing the girl, who walks away. While trying to find Felicit√†, the two run into Jolly, who is shopping for caraway to concoct some medicine. Jolly believes that Luca has been secretly using a large amount of caraway for unknown reasons. Libert√† and Nova pass by a fortune teller, who gives them a riddle which leads them to Federica at her dress shop. Meanwhile, Luca brings Felicit√†, Debito and Pace to his secret base away from the mansion, a place where he harvests a small herb garden yearly. Libert√† and Nova follow Federica's kitten to a cave which leads to the herb garden, but the two fall for the traps set by Luca designed to ward off Jolly, having to use each other's swords to bypass them. Once Libert√† and Nova meet Felicit√†, Luca, Debito and Pace in the herb garden during lunchtime, Debito unlocks the handcuffs and Luca shows them a potion containing caraway that was made to lure the kitten from the dress shop to the herb garden. Pace uses his camera to take a picture of all six of them at the herb garden, each of them having a copy for a keepsake. It is shown that Sumire had Jovanna act as the fortune teller. The letter that Felicit√† received from Sumire told her to kiss Libert√† and Nova on their cheeks due to the amount of trouble went through to deliver the letter. A light novel, Arcana Famiglia: La Primavera was published by Filia Bunko, a label of Frontier Works. Frontier Works also published a series of drama CDs for the franchise. The character designer and main artist for the games is Yomi Sarachi. She also did character design for the comic version and illustrations for the novel. Both the openings for the first game and the fan disc are sung by Hitomi Harada, while the endings of the first game are sung by the voice actor whose character's route has been completed. The fan disc Vascello Phantasma no Majutsushi sold 4,854 copies in the first four days it was sold, making it the fifteenth best selling console game in Japan that week. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network (ANN) reviewed the first half of the anime series. Santos commended the top-notch action scenes and character designs for making the cast look distinct from one another but criticized both the animation and backgrounds for being \"a mixed bag of genuine effort and cost-cutting laziness\" and the filler approach to storytelling that may cause viewers to lose interest before the second-half of the series. Fellow ANN editor Rebecca Silverman reviewed the complete anime series in 2014. While giving praise to the Italian setting and the characterization of both Libert√† and Nova, Silverman felt that Felicit√† lacked development amongst her harem and the overall plot only acted as bookends to the mid-portion adaptation of the game's events. She concluded that devoted harem fans will enjoy aspects of the series but cautioned others to look elsewhere for the action, rom-com story it promised in the beginning."

        "title": "Super Mario Party Jamboree",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Party_Jamboree",
        "text": "Super Mario Party Jamboree is a 2024 party video game developed by Nintendo Cube (previously known as NDcube) and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. It is the thirteenth home console installment in the Mario Party series, and the third on the Nintendo Switch, following Super Mario Party, and Mario Party Superstars. Like most installments in the Mario Party series, the main gameplay loop features players, either human or computer-controlled, using characters from the Mario franchise to compete in a board game with minigames after each turn. The game features a single-player mission mode as well as several other game modes, some of which require the use of motion controls. Typically up to four human players can compete at a time, but depending on the game mode, up to twenty human players can compete via online matchmaking. Super Mario Party Jamboree received positive reviews, with general praise for its game board selection, multiplayer functionality, and general polish, but criticism for some of its game modes. Some have considered it to be one of the best Mario Party games to date. An upgraded port for the Nintendo Switch 2, featuring new modes and minigames, is scheduled for release on July 24, 2025. Super Mario Party Jamboree's gameplay is split between numerous different modes, most of which require the usage of Joy-Con controllers and all of which can be accessed in the game's hub area called the \"Party Plaza\". In the hub, the player can access their game data and settings, listen to the game's selection of music, customize different aspects of the hub and change their player character. The game boasts 22 playable characters (Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Wario, Waluigi, Yoshi, Toadette, Toad, Rosalina, Donkey Kong, Birdo, Bowser, Goomba, Shy Guy, Koopa Troopa, Monty Mole, Bowser Jr., Boo, Spike, and newcomers Pauline and Ninji) which makes for the current largest roster of playable characters in the Mario Party series. These characters can be controlled by human players as well as artificial intelligence (AI). Much like other games in the Mario Party series, Super Mario Party Jamboree's main mode, dubbed simply \"Mario Party\", is an interactive board game that allows up to four players, human or computer controlled, to compete to collect the most stars by the end of a set number of turns (ten through thirty), with different items and board mechanics that either help or harm the players chances of success. After each turn has ended the players play a minigame. A majority of minigames use motion controls, though it is possible to turn off the motion-controlled minigames to allow for minigames only using button controls. The board mechanic of allies from Super Mario Party makes a revamped return in the form of \"Jamboree Buddies\". Modeled after ten of the available player characters, Jamboree Buddies appear on the board after a certain amount of turns and, when passed, will trigger a minigame to see which player will obtain them. Jamboree Buddies last for up to three turns, activate a board space effect twice and grant players different abilities that vary depending on the one obtained. For example, Waluigi steals coins from opponents that he passes. Alongside the traditional set of rules, a more competitive ruleset called \"Pro Rules\" is available to select which is designed to remove most luck-based aspects found in traditional play. Super Mario Party Jamboree contains a single-player mission mode called the \"Party Planner Trek\", in which players help various NPC's by either talking to them, fetching an item or playing a minigame in exchange for Mini-Stars which are then used to further progress in the mode and unlock hub customization options. After collecting a certain number of Mini-Stars in an area, the player must complete a boss minigame in order to progress to the next area. In Boss Minigames, the players goal is to deplete a large enemy's health bar in a similar style to traditional video game boss fights. In the \"Minigame Bay\" mode, players can freely play any of the minigames or play a set number of minigames that are pre-selected based on their specific type or theme, such as 1 vs 3. A Boss Rush sub-mode, which is unlocked after earning thirty in-game achievements, makes players compete in every boss minigame with the final goal of having the highest score by the end. Three motion controlled modes are present and require the usage of singular Joy-Con controllers to function. \"Rhythm Kitchen\" lets players work together in rhythm based minigames themed around cooking. \"Toad's Item Factory\" is a ball physics-based puzzler which tasks players to work together in moving different contraptions to get a ball to a goal to create thirty items. \"Paratroopa Flight School\" requires players to use two singular Joy-Con controllers in order to mimic flapping wings and flight. Paratroopa Flight School has three sub-modes which allow players to compete in time-based collection matches, cooperate in carrying characters to destinations or freely fly around a map without any predetermined objective. Two multiplayer-focused modes are present. \"Bowser Kaboom Squad\" is a cooperative mode where eight players race to defeat Impostor Bowser by collecting bombs, occasionally playing a minigame to obtain items which help the players defeat him quicker. \"Koopathlon\" is a race where twenty different players compete to complete a set number of laps around a board via collecting coins in minigames. After three minigames, a themed Bowser minigame will be played where if a player loses, they will be sent backwards a different number of spaces, the number of spaces being determined on their current position. [ citation needed ] The game supports both local and online multiplayer, with most modes being able to support the former or the latter in some capacity. Players can set up private online lobbies protected by a passcode in order to play with friends. The game also contains an online leaderboard where minigame high scores are logged. On April 2, 2025, during a Nintendo Direct, Super Mario Party Jamboree was announced to have an upgraded port on the Nintendo Switch 2. The port includes enhanced graphics and frame rate and new modes that utilize mouse controls, full-body movement recognition through the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera and the microphone built into the console itself. It is scheduled for release on July 24, 2025. Super Mario Party Jamboree was first announced on June 18, 2024, during a Nintendo Direct. Described to be \"the biggest Mario Party to date\", the presentation announced 112 minigames, seven boards (including Mario's Rainbow Castle and Western Land, which previously appeared in Mario Party and Mario Party 2, respectively), and thirty-seven items. Also announced during the presentation was the online twenty-player \"Koopathlon\" mode. An overview trailer, released on September 24, 2024, showed off all the motion-based modes (Paratroopa Flight School, Toad‚Äôs Item Factory, and Rhythm Kitchen) and the online eight-player \"Bowser Kaboom Squad\" mode. This is the first time that Kevin Afghani voices Waluigi, as Charles Martinet had stepped down from voicing the character, along with Mario, Luigi and Wario. Super Mario Party Jamboree received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic, and is currently the highest rated Mario Party game on the website. IGN's Logan Plant lauded the game as \"an amazing follow-up to Mario Party Superstars and easily one of the best games in the series\". Nintendo Life's PJ O'Reilly likewise praised Super Mario Party Jamboree as \"the best Mario Party to date\". Ozzie Mejia of Shacknews agreed that the game is \"one of the most polished entries in the series yet\". Writing for GameSpot, Dan Ryckert complimented the game boards, though criticized some of the game modes and minigames. In a more critical review, Eurogamer's Katharine Castle wrote that Super Mario Party Jamboree \"has the misfortune of not being very fun, and mistakes the volatility of chance and happenstance for being the same thing as competitive satisfaction that comes from playing a good game well\". The game performed well commercially, debuting atop the charts in Japan with retail sales of 227,569 copies. It also debuted atop the charts in the UK, enjoying opening week sales that were 35 percent higher than that of Mario Party Superstars. On January 16, 2025, it was reported that the game had sold over one million copies in Japan. Super Mario Party Jamboree was nominated for \"Best Family Game\" and \"Best Multiplayer\" at The Game Awards 2024, as well as \" Family Game of the Year \" at the 28th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards."

        "text": "Wuchang: Fallen Feathers (ÊòéÊú´ÔºöÊ∏äËôö‰πãÁæΩ) is an upcoming Soulslike action role-playing game developed by Leenzee and published by 505 Games. The player assumes the role of Bai Wuchang, a female pirate, embarking on a journey through the war-torn and plagued lands of Shu during the late Ming dynasty. Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is scheduled to release for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S on 24 July 2025. Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is a Soulslike action role-playing game. It is played in single-player mode from a third-person perspective. The player controls Bai Wuchang, a female pirate. She starts with the Cloudfrost's Edge, a weapon based on the changdao, a type of single-edged longsword. The combat system centers around Skyborn Might. It enables her to use weapon skills tied to her equipped weapon and discipline skills tied to its weapon type. There are twenty-five unique weapons, each offering a distinct combat style, spread across five weapon types. They can be equipped as a primary or secondary weapon. In addition, there are forty different spells, which can be assigned to four spell slots. They can be integrated into weapon combos, but a playstyle focused on spells is also possible. When the player character kills a humanoid enemy or dies, her Inner Demon increases, eventually manifesting as a glowing red mark at the nape of her neck, indicating that her abilities are enhanced but also that she is more susceptible to damage. If the mark is active when she dies, the Inner Demon appears as an hostile entity haunting the area where she perished. It shares the form of Wuchang herself, wielding her weapons, spells, and items. Wuchang can obtain different outfits, including armor, from enemies. The design of the clothing corresponds to the enemy from which the clothing is obtained from. The game takes place in a world with interconnected areas. The traversal between areas is seamless, but access may initially be restricted. The world is populated by many non-player characters, who can be interacted with and may provide side quests. There are altars, which act as checkpoints for the player. The player character respawns at the last visited altar after a defeat. The story has multiple endings and is influenced by side quests. Wuchang: Fallen Feathers takes place in the war-torn and plagued lands of Shu during the late Ming dynasty. The game has five chapters. A lore trailer, released in February 2025, depicted a mythical war between avian factions led by Duriel (Duyu; ÊùúÂÆá) and Bieling (È≥ñÁÅµ), set before the events of the game. During the late Ming dynasty, the lands of Shu is devasted by warring factions and plagued by a mysterious illness known as the Feathering Disease, which drives its victims insane and gradually transforms them into monstrous beings. Bai Wuchang, a female pirate, suffers from amnesia and is afflicted with the disease. Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is a game developed by Leenzee and published by 505 Games. It was built using Unreal Engine 5. The game draws inspiration from ancient societies in Shu such as Sanxingdui and Jinsha as well as historical or mythical elements featured in literature such as Shuwang Benji (ËúÄÁéãÊú¨Á∫™), Jinse (Èî¶Áëü), and Shanhaijing (Â±±Êµ∑Áªè). Xia Siyuan commented that the success of Black Myth: Wukong, which gave a lot of positive signs and a lot of confidence in the future of studios as well as validated the market, proved to them internally that it was the right decision to start Wuchang: Fallen Feathers and their game is on the right track. Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is scheduled to release for PC (Windows), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S on 24 July 2025. It will be available as a Day One release on the subscription service Xbox Game Pass. Leenzee first revealed Wuchang: Fallen Feathers with a gameplay showcase during the High Energy Video Game Festival (È´òËÉΩÁîµÁé©ËäÇ), organized by Bilibili, on 17 September 2021. It was in development for about a year and a half at the time. During the Xbox Games Showcase in June 2024, Leenzee and 505 Games released a trailer announcing Wuchang: Fallen Feathers with a 2025 release window. In March 2025, the social media channels for the game confirmed a summer 2025 launch. In April 2025, Leenzee and 505 Games released a trailer announcing a release date of 24 July 2025. Pre-orders for Wuchang: Fallen Feathers launched on 29 April 2025. The pre-order bonus comprise the Night & White Pack, which contains two costume sets, a weapon, and a skill upgrade item. The Deluxe Edition offers the base game along with four costume sets, four weapons, and a skill upgrade item. Wuchang: Fallen Feathers won Surprise of the Year and was nominated for Most Anticipated Game at the UCG Game Awards 2024."

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Hearts_(video_game)",
        "text": "Wild Hearts is a 2023 action role-playing video game developed by Koei Tecmo under their Omega Force label and published by Electronic Arts under its EA Originals label. The game tasks the player to hunt massive monsters in Azuma, a fantasy world inspired by feudal Japan. The game was released for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S on February 17. It is also set to be released for the Nintendo Switch 2 as Wild Hearts S, published by Koei Tecmo, on July 25, 2025. Players assume the role of a nameless hunter, who must embark on quests to hunt down massive monsters known as Kemono in the world of Azuma. Azuma is not an open world, but instead, several large areas that players can freely explore. The game features eight different weapon types, including the likes of wagasa and katana. In addition to using weapons to defeat enemies, players can also build items to assist combat through the Karakuri mechanic. For instance, players can build crates which can be leapt off of to perform powerful attacks, or a torch which can be used to ignite enemies. These items can be combined to form larger machines, such as a bulwark that blocks an enemy's path. Constructed items are permanent until they are destroyed by Kemono. Players can also build Karakuri to aid transversal. Building Karakuri consumes thread, which can be acquired through simply attacking enemies. As the player progresses in the game, they will unlock new weapons and armors, allowing players to hunt more challenging monsters. The team estimated that players can complete the game's narrative campaign in about 30 hours. Players can team up with two other players as they progress in the game. A kemono hunter travels to Azuma after leaving their distant homeland because of warring Samurais and a decline in kemono hunting. The Hunter finds a small piece of Karakuri technology from a mummified corpse before battling a large, ice wielding wolf kemono. The Hunter loses the fight and is left for dead, but is rescued by a mysterious old man named Mujina. Mujina activates and imparts the Karakuri ‚Äúseed‚Äù the Hunter found into their heart and informs the Hunter to head to the town of Minato. The Hunter regains consciousness and discovers their new found power to conjure up Karakuri objects and harvest celestial threads to fuel their new power. While traveling to Minato, the Hunter rescues the town's blacksmith Natsume and her escort Ujishige from Kemonos. At the request of the town's steward, Toga-hime, the Hunter assists in helping the destitute town prosper by hunting kemono materials. Later, with the help of the town's Karakuri expert Surazan, the Hunter restores the flow of celestial thread to power dormant Karakuri technologies in the town. This however attracts the attention of a gigantic Kemono called Earthbreaker, who hungers for the town's concentration of celestial thread after it was diverted from its territory. The Hunter rallies the townsfolks to defend Minato and slays the beast. As the town celebrates their victory and witness a revered bird of prey kemono Amaterasu fly close by, Suruzan uncovers old records that indicate celestial thread supplies are waning across Azuma and are causing unrest among kemonos. While out on a mission with Ujishige in the Natsukodachi Isle the duo notice that the environment, normally rocky and aquatic, has become completely frozen over and spot the same ice wolf kemono that nearly killed the Hunter, now called Deathstalker; deeming it responsible for the drastic environmental changes. Surazan hypothesizes that the decrease in celestial threads is causing the Deathstalker to venture far from its territory, the Fuyufusagi Fort, way up north. Ujishige reveals to the Hunter that he was once a retainer for the daimyo who governed from the Fuyufusagi Fort until kemonos led by the Deathstalker turned the area into a frozen wasteland. The Hunter kills the Deathstalker at the fort and both Ujishige and the Hunter escape from two more Deathstalkers after Amaterasu intervenes and fights them. Surazan discovers that the deceased Deathstalker contains only meager amounts of celestial thread in its system, confirming her hypothesis that the Deathstalker ventured far from its territory in a desperate search for celestial threads. The Hunter and Ujishige further confirm Surazan's findings after discovering that other power kemono variants are migrating far from their usually habitats and are drastically altering the natural environment. The duo returns to Minato only to witness Amaterasu attacking the town to claim its concentration of celestial threads. Mujina arrives and warns the Hunter that the kemonos‚Äô increasingly aggressive and desperate search for scarce celestial threads is sending Azuma into chaos. The Hunter, Ujishige, Natsume, and Surazan bolster the town's defenses and rallies the townsfolks once more to defend against Amaterasu's second arrival. The Hunter slays Amaterasu, helps rebuild Minato, and later slays two more powerful kemonos that have caused a wildfire near Minato. However, the over usage of the Karakuri ‚Äúseed‚Äù causes the Hunter to suffer cardiac arrest and collapse. Simultaneously Azuma begins to experience a never-ending relentless rainfall that is causing severe ecological damage across Azuma. Mujina appears again and warns the Hunter that the ‚ÄúRain of a Thousand Days‚Äù has occurred, informing the Hunter to end it they must hunt the ‚Äúsource kemono‚Äù atop of the Sacred Mountain. As Mujina disappears it is revealed that he is actually the spirit of numerous hunters that failed to quell the ‚ÄúRain of a Thousand Days‚Äù that plaque Azuma in ancient past, leading to the downfall of an ancient hunter community in Minato that once used Karakuri. The Hunter scales the mountain and slays a Celestial Dragon to gain entrance inside the mountain. There the Hunter confronts the Celestial Being, an entity that guards the source of the celestial threads. The Hunter slays the Celestial Being and activates an ancient Kakakuri structure that restores the flow of celestial threads before losing consciousness. The restoration of celestial threads quells the endless rainfall, heals Azuma's ecosystems, and placates the kemonos. The Hunter regains consciousness and returns to Minato. In the postgame, if the Hunter slays four deeply volatile kemonos they will converse with Mujina once more, who congratulates the Hunter for accomplishing what no human or kemono could ever achieve. The game was developed by Japanese developer Omega Force, a division of Koei Tecmo. Development of the game started in 2018 and used Koei Tecmo's in-house engine called \"Katana Engine\". According to game director Kotaro Hirata, the team learned from their experience developing the Toukiden series, and intended to create a modern Japanese monster-hunting game. To stand out from other monster hunting games, the team introduced Kemono, monsters which were described as \"a fusion of nature and animals\", and Karakuri, a building mechanic which supplements the game's melee combat. Monsters and creatures were designed to be threatening and challenging, so that players would not feel \"guilty\" about killing them. The team did not make Wild Hearts an installment in the Toukiden series because they felt that the game had its own distinct presentation and combat mechanics. The game world was inspired by feudal Japan, and it features four different biomes, each based on one of the four seasons. Originally the game supported four-player multiplayer; this was later altered as the team believed that it would create imbalanced gameplay. Hirata, mentioned in an Interview with The Verge, that Dynasty Warriors had become a pillar franchise for Omega Force, and that with Wild Hearts, they hoped to have another strong pillar franchise. Publisher Electronic Arts announced its partnership with Omega Force and its parent company Koei Tecmo on September 14, 2022. The game would be published under its EA Originals label, which had previously released smaller, independent video games such as It Takes Two and Unravel. The game was officially announced on September 23, 2022. Wild Hearts was released for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S on February 17, 2023, with support for cross-platform play. The game is also set to be released for the Nintendo Switch 2 as Wild Heart S on July 25, 2025 by Koei Tecmo, without involvement from Electronic Arts. Wild Hearts received \"generally favorable\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Rock Paper Shotgun enjoyed the title's building mechanics, saying it made the player feel \"less of a mythical superhero and more of a desperate inventor\", but criticized how poor performance was on Windows. Eurogamer praised the game's feudal Japan-inspired world, \"it's beautiful stuff ‚Äì and even more impressive once rampaging Kemono start smashing it to bits\". The Verge liked the music and the scope of the fights, writing \"The sweeping orchestral score and the sheer size and power of the monsters make even the one-star hunts feel like an epic battle\". NPR praised the game's monster appearance and power design, saying \"stunning and enormous animals superpowered by primal nature\". The PlayStation 5 version of Wild Hearts was the second bestselling retail game during its first week of release in Japan, with 26,905 physical copies being sold across the country."

        "text": "Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana is a 2016 action role-playing game developed by Nihon Falcom and published by NIS America. A part of the Ys series, it was first released in Japan by Falcom for the PlayStation Vita in July 2016, with later worldwide releases for PlayStation 4, Windows, Nintendo Switch, Amazon Luna, Stadia and PlayStation 5. An abridged version for Android and iOS, Ys VIII Mobile, is also scheduled for release. Ys VIII had sold over 500,000 copies by the end of 2018. The game was followed up by Ys IX: Monstrum Nox in 2019. Adol is on a passenger ship called the Lombardia that is headed from Xandria to the continent of Eresia, but the ship is attacked in the archipelagos of the Gaete Sea by a giant creature and is sunk, and when Adol wakes up, he realizes he landed on the shore of a cursed island known as the Isle of Seiren. On his search for other survivors, he teams up with the noblewoman Laxia von Roswell and fisherman Sahad Nautilus to help his fellow castaways to survive and find a way to get off the island. At the same time, he wants to find out what lies behind his dreams about Dana Iclucia, a mysterious girl from a prehistoric era who seemingly has a connection to the Isle of Seiren and Adol's fate. Adol's party is soon expanded to include Hummel Trabaldo, a transporter who was a passenger on the Lombardia, and Ricotta Beldine, a resident of the Isle of Seiren. While exploring the island for additional castaways, Laxia notes the creatures on the island are unlike anything known to the outside world. Citing her father's academic research, she concludes that the monsters are an extinct group of animals known as Primordials. Further exploration in the north of the island leads the group to the ruins of an ancient civilization known as Eternia, whose residents possessed a power known as Essence. It is here where the party discovers Dana, waking from a deep slumber, telling the group she is the last of the Eternians but does not know why, nor why she is alive in the current era, as she is suffering from amnesia. The castaways begin to build a ship to escape the island; Adol's party continues to explore the island from clues on what sank the Lombardia. After research into the matter, it is discovered that a Primordial known as the Oceanus was responsible for the sinking of their ship, as it has historically attacked ships since before Dana's era. The castaways band together and defeat the Oceanus, allowing for safe travel in the surrounding sea, but questions surrounding the Primordials and Dana's situation lead the group to continue to explore the island. By doing this, Dana begins to slowly regain her memories. She discovers that multiple meteorites crashed into Eternia long ago, killing many people and triggering events akin to a nuclear winter which led to the extinction of Eternians. This event was brought forth by a process called the Lacrimosa, which triggers an extinction event after the primary species on earth has run its course. During each Lacrimosa, one member of the species is chosen to survive and become an immortal Warden of Evolution, one who watches over the Lacrimosa and ensures the process is successfully carried out. Dana was chosen to be the protector representing Eternians; she resisted and put herself into a deep sleep until the next Lacrimosa would occur. Dana awoke in the present because the current Lacrimosa was beginning: the extinction of humans, to be accomplished through the revival of Primordials as the primary species. Consequently, Adol is selected to be the next Warden of Evolution, representing the human species. With Dana's help, Adol's crew becomes the first group to resist the Lacrimosa, ending the process and ensuring the continued survival of the human race. Stopping the Lacrimosa does not go as planned, and the world begins to collapse. Dana uses her essence to disrupt the end of the world, but dies in the process. Shortly thereafter, while mourning the loss of Dana, the goddess of the world, Maia, makes an appearance, telling the group that Dana's sacrifice has led her to become the Goddess of Evolution, tasked with watching over the world. Dana and the other protectors appear; Dana wishes goodbye to Adol's group, while the other Protectors inform Adol the Lacrimosa may still need to be used in the future to prevent the world from collapsing. After the Protectors and Goddess'disappear, the castaways finish construction of their ship and sail home, parting ways and returning to their normal lives. Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana is an action role-playing game played from a third-person perspective. It builds on the gameplay foundation of Ys Seven and Ys: Memories of Celceta, where players control multiple main characters that can be switched between on-the-fly, each with their own play styles and unique skills. The player collects a variety of materials by defeating local wildlife and opening chests. These materials can be crafted into items that the player can use on their journey, such as healing items and stronger weapons. Various fellow shipwrecked passengers can be rescued and brought to the village where they will provide valuable services. There are three damage types, determined by a character's weapon: Slash, Strike, and Pierce. Enemies will take more damage from a damage type they are vulnerable against. Skills can be assigned to a corresponding button and using skills requires SP, which can be refilled mainly by landing a fully-charged attack against an enemy. Each character has a powerful move called an EXTRA Skill that can only be used when the EXTRA Gauge is filled. Furthermore, players can attempt to parry attacks or evade them shortly before the attack lands. Successfully parrying an attack will activate Flash Guard for a short period of time, where all damage from enemies is nullified and all attacks will deliver critical damage. Similarly, successfully evading an attack by performing a dodge roll will activate Flash Move for a short period of time, where everything but the player will move in slow motion. As the story progresses, the game continuously switches perspectives between its two protagonists‚ÄîAdol and Dana. Adol's exploration of the Isle of Seiren can be affected by Dana's actions in her world, such as opening a new path or altering the landscape. An experimental co-op multiplayer feature was added to the PC version in January 2020. Ys VIII was announced in August 2014 for PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 4. It was released in Japan on July 21, 2016. It is the first game in the Ys series to be released for PlayStation 4 as well as the first time that Falcom worked on a PlayStation 4 game.

The game was released for the Nintendo Switch worldwide in June 2018. A version for Amazon Luna was released on October 20, 2020. It came in both standard edition and a limited edition with several collectibles. A PlayStation 5 version was released worldwide in November 2022.

A port for Android and iOS, developed by Linekong Entertainment, was announced in April 2019 with a release date originally set for 2020 before being delayed.

Famitsu scored the game a 34/40. They stated that the story is better than predecessors, and liked the pace of battle. The game's original English localization was met with criticism for its quality.

An update addressing these concerns, including fully rerecorded dialogue, was released in January 2018. The game's release on Windows was also met with criticism due to its poor technical performance. A patch addressing the issues was released in January 2020. The game won the award for \"Best Action Combat System\" at Game Informer's 2017 RPG of the Year Awards. On its first week of release in Japan, the PlayStation Vita version of Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana reached second place in game sales charts with 43,753 units sold. The PlayStation 4 version sold 27,741 units in its first week, surpassing Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Falcom president and game producer Toshihiro Kondo stated that the Nintendo Switch version met sales expectations outside of Japan. By October 2018, sales of the game surpassed over 500,000 copies, and by August 2019, had reached over 600,000 copies worldwide."

        "text": "Mafia: The Old Country is an upcoming action-adventure game developed by Hangar 13 and published by 2K. It is a prequel to the first game and the fourth main entry in the Mafia series. The game is scheduled to release for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S in mid 2025. The game is based in Sicily in the 1900s, in the fictional town of San Celeste, which was previously featured in Mafia II. It is based around the origins of the Mafia. The narrative follows original protagonist Enzo Favara who journeys from a childhood of indentured labor in Sicily's sulfur mines to joining the Torrisi crime family. Mafia: The Old Country is a third-person linear, narrative -driven game set in cinematic environments. This brings the game more in alignment with Mafia and Mafia II rather than the more open-world oriented Mafia III. In August 2022, Hangar 13 general manager Roman Hlad√≠k confirmed in an interview marking the 20th anniversary of Mafia that Hangar 13 had \"started work on an all-new Mafia project\" but it would still be \"a few years away\". With the fourth Mafia title, Hangar 13 sought to go \"back to the roots of what fans love about the Mafia franchise,\" according to Hangar 13 president Nick Baynes. This meant a return to \"deep linear narrative\" with a setting more aligned with the first Mafia game. Mafia: The Old Country includes full audio dubbing in English, French, German, Spanish, Czech, and Russian, but not Italian, despite the game addressing the origins of organized crime in Sicily. Italian localization can only been found as a subtitle option. In response to the controversy, Hangar 13 announced that the game would offer voice acting in the Sicilian language, saying that \"Authenticity is at the heart of the Mafia franchise\". Mafia: The Old Country was developed using Unreal Engine 5 with Alex Cox serving as the game's director. Cox said that moving to Unreal Engine 5 has \"allowed for an even higher level of visual fidelity than previous Mafia titles\". Mafia: The Old Country was revealed via a teaser trailer at Gamescom: Opening Night Live 2024 on August 20, 2024. A full trailer debuted at The Game Awards 2024, though it was leaked several hours earlier. The game is scheduled to release for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S in 2025."

It is set to be released for Windows, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Series S on September 4, 2025. Hell Is Us is an action-adventure video game played from a third-person perspective. In the game, the player assumes control of a soldier named R√©mi, and fights against supernatural beings named \"Hollow Walkers\". Players can combat these creatures using a variety of melee weapons such as swords, polearms and axes, with each having their own attack style and speed. R√©mi is also equipped with a drone which can be used to distract hostile creatures. Players need to manage both the health and stamina of R√©mi. Stamina will gradually regenerate but health will not, though R√©mi's maximum stamina at any given moment is limited by his current health level. Fighting in an exhausted state means that the player character attacks more weakly and is more vulnerable. Hadea was described by the team as a \"semi- open world \", and the game tasks players to gather clues to find R√©mi's parents. The game forgoes features commonly found in other games such as waypoints, quest logs and map markers. Players must listen to R√©mi's conversations with non-playable characters in order to find out the locations of their objectives. A United Nations peacekeeper named R√©mi goes absent without leave and venture into the war-torn country of Hadea to find his parents, only to discover that the region is infested with supernatural beings following a mysterious event named the \"Calamity\". The game is currently being developed by Rogue Factor, the studio behind Mordheim: City of the Damned. The project was led by Jonathan Jacques-Belletete, the art director for Deus Ex: Human Revolution and its sequel, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. According to Jacques-Bellet√™te, the game was inspired by the 2018 film Annihilation, and the Southern Reach Trilogy by Jeff VanderMeer. The game adopted a minimalistic head-up display as the studio was influenced by games released in the 1990s and wanted to create an immersive experience in which players receive information in an \"organic\" way. Jacques-Belletete compared the combat system to those commonly found in hack and slash games, one that is neither overly easy nor hard. Hell Is Us was first announced by publisher Nacon in April 2022, and was scheduled to be released in 2023. The game resurfaced in September 2024 during Sony's State of Play livestream event, and is scheduled to be released on September 4, 2025 for Windows, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and Series S."

        "text": "This list of Terminator video games includes video games based on the Terminator film series. The films generally focus on humans attempting to prevent the rise of Skynet, an artificial intelligence. In the future, Skynet will wipe out most of humanity with help from its army of Terminator machines. The first Terminator game was released for DOS in July 1991, and is based on the original film, The Terminator (1984). Other games based on the first film and its sequel, Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), were released over the next two years. Subsequent films also received game adaptations, and several non-film based games have also been released. Several video games titled The Terminator were released, each of them based on the 1984 film of the same name. By 1988, Danish company Robtek had acquired the license to create games based on the film, but it subsequently went into receivership before any game could be released. By mid-1989, development was underway by Sunsoft on a Terminator game, which would be released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). However, Sunsoft lost the license and eventually published the game as Journey to Silius in 1990. Sunsoft reportedly lost the Terminator license because the game did not follow the plot of the film, instead focusing solely on Kyle Reese as he battles Skynet's machines in the future. Gameplay footage had been shown at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in 1989, and the footage would resurface 30 years later. The Terminator is a DOS action-adventure game based on the first movie. In mid-1990, Bethesda Softworks announced a deal with the Hemdale Film Corporation to create computer video games based on The Terminator. Bethesda Softworks developed and published the game in July 1991. It was the first game based on the Terminator film series. A shoot'em up game, titled The Terminator, was developed by Probe Software and published by Virgin Games. It was released in 1992, for several Sega consoles: the Mega Drive/Genesis, the Master System, and the Game Gear. Another shoot'em up game, also titled The Terminator, was released for the Sega CD. It was developed and published by Virgin Games in 1993. The graphics and music took advantage of the Sega CD's capabilities, and the game includes the use of full motion video from the film. A side-scrolling action game titled The Terminator was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in December 1992. Gameplay consists of platforming and driving stages, with Kyle Reese as the player character. It was sublicensed by Bethesda Softworks, developed by Radical Entertainment, and published by Mindscape. Gary Whitta of Computer and Video Games (CVG) was critical of the graphics, and considered the gameplay outdated with no originality. He rated it 61 out of 100, while MegaFun rated it 55 out of 100. Another side-scrolling action game, also titled The Terminator, was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). It was developed by Gray Matter and published by Mindscape in April 1993. The SNES version also puts the player in control of Kyle Reese. It features levels based on the film, including the future war in 2029, and the police station and nightclub in Los Angeles 1984. It also includes several driving levels. CVG rated the SNES version 70 out of 100. The magazine criticized the graphics, stating that they resembled an 8-bit game rather than the 16-bit capability of the SNES. CVG also criticized the difficulty, stating that checkpoints are placed too far apart. N-Force found the gameplay boring and exceedingly difficult, rating the game 55 out of 100. Nintendo Power considered the game an improvement over Mindscape's NES version. The magazine praised the graphics and music, while MegaFun found the graphics dreary and the sound monotonous, rating the game 58 out of 100. Reviewers for GameFan were critical of the game but praised its driving levels. A mobile game, The Terminator, was released in 2003. It is a shoot'em up developed and published by In-Fusio. Several video games based on Terminator 2: Judgment Day were released between 1991 and 1993. A pinball game designed by Steve Ritchie and released by Williams Electronics in 1991. A chess game developed by IntraCorp and published by Capstone Software for MS-DOS in 1993. Characters from Terminator 2: Judgment Day act as chess pieces. White is the \"human\" side, with the T-800 as king, Sarah Connor as queen, two John Connors as bishops, two Miles Dysons as knights, and soldiers in green uniforms as rooks and pawns. Black is the \"machines\" side: gray-colored robots with metal skeletons, without the T-1000. The pieces are not taken on the chess board but in futuristic battlefield settings resembling the scenes of the man-machine war from the movie. The player can choose from several game types and difficulty settings. The game rates the player in accordance with the United States Chess Federation scale. Computer Gaming World stated in 1994 that Chess Wars was one of \"a host of imitations and look-alikes\" of Battle Chess. The magazine reported that it crashed so often that the chess engine could not be evaluated because no game was completed, the SVGA graphics were \"unimpressive\", transitioning between the board and battles was \"painfully slow\" and the pieces were poorly animated, and falsely claimed to have 4500 chess openings when it lacked an opening library. Computer Gaming World concluded that T2 Chess Wars and Star Wars Chess \"are examples of marketing at its best (or worst, depending on your point of view)\". Developed by Isle of Man -based betting software developer Microgaming and released in June 2014, this video slot game is a 5-reel online slot machine with a free spins bonus feature and a T-1000 theme. Microgaming CEO Roger Raatgever said, \"We've taken the core elements of the iconic Terminator 2 film to create an online slot that does the brand justice. Visually it is stunning and it has a fitting game mechanic that is completely unique to the online gaming market. Our operators and their players will be awestruck by our creation; we are incredibly excited about the game launch today.\" Several games are based on Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. The first game, titled after the film, was released in 2003. It is a first-person shooter game with elements of hand-to-hand combat in the third-person perspective. It was developed by Black Ops and published by Atari for PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Another first-person shooter game, Terminator 3: War of the Machines, was also released in 2003, for Microsoft Windows. In 2004, Terminator 3: The Redemption was released for several consoles. A pinball game was also manufactured by Stern Pinball for release in 2003. It was designed by Steve Ritchie and includes voice acting by Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator. It is similar to the pinball game Terminator 2: Judgment Day, also by Ritchie. A third-person shooter action game titled Terminator Salvation, based on the film of the same name, was released in 2009. An arcade game based on the film, developed by Play Mechanix and published by Raw Thrills, was released in 2010. It is a light gun game featuring next-generation graphics. Two players can cooperate simultaneously using machine gun-styled light guns to blast terminators, drones, and other enemies while pushing a button on the magazine well of the gun in order to reload. For the 2015 film Terminator Genisys, two mobile games were released. Terminator Genisys: Revolution, also called Terminator Genisys: Guardian, was developed and published by Glu Games, and released in June 2015. It is a free-to-play third-person shooter with micro-transactions that include new characters and weapons. Jon Mundy of Pocket Gamer called it \"another shallow movie tie-in, high on action, spectacle, and (especially) IAPS, but low on depth and content\". A game, based on Terminator Genisys: Revolution, was also shown in select theaters prior to the showing of the film, with viewers aiming their mobile phones at the screen to shoot Terminators. In June 2016, Skydance Media granted Plarium the rights to develop a new mobile game based on the film. The game, Terminator Genisys: Future War, was released in May 2017. It is an MMO strategy video game, set during the future war between humans and Skynet. Jessica Famularo of Pocket Gamer criticized the grinding gameplay and minimal storyline, and called it the \" Terminator game you neither wanted nor asked for\". Terminator: Dark Fate ‚Äì The Game is an MMO strategy video game developed by Firefly Games and the China-based Camel Games for Android and iOS. It is based on the 2019 film of the same name. Firefly Games began working on the game in 2017, after being contacted by the film's production company, Skydance Media. The game was released on October 18, 2019, and a global release occurred on November 8, 2019. In the game, the player commands a group of Resistance fighters who must defend against machine attacks. The player can expand the group's Resistance base and can also form alliances with other players. The player is guided by characters from the film. The game is free-to-play but utilizes in-app purchases in exchange for various resources. Terminator: Guardian of Fate, a virtual reality game by VRstudios, was also launched in November 2019, as a tie-in to Dark Fate. The game is exclusive to the Dave & Buster's chain, debuting at 130 locations across the U.S. It uses HTC Vive headsets and supports up to four players. Like the film, it features the return of Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, though in a voice-over role. In the game, Connor and players travel together in a vehicle to evade a terminator. Another game, Terminator: Dark Fate ‚Äì Defiance, was released on PC on February 21, 2024. It is a real-time strategy game that takes place after Judgment Day, during the war between humans and the A.I. known as Legion. The player assumes the role of a commander in the Founders, a group consisting of ex-U.S. military personnel. A multiplayer mode also features two additional teams: the human resistance and Legion. Slitherine Software is the game's developer and publisher, in collaboration with Skydance. The game received \"mixed or average\" reviews according to Metacritic, with a score of 72 out of 100. Alex Avard of Empire found the quality of Terminator games to be inconsistent, but wrote that Dark Fate ‚Äì Defiance, with its \"tightly designed\" gameplay, \"may have just helped to raise that historically low bar a little bit higher.\" Jon Bolding of IGN criticized the game's difficulty. Several games, not based on any particular film, have been released since 1992. Terminator characters have also made appearances in non- Terminator games."

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Rock_Galactic:_Survivor",
        "text": "Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is a shoot'em up video game by Funday Games. It is a top down spin-off of the first-person shooter Deep Rock Galactic modeled on the auto-shooter Vampire Survivors. The player controls a dwarf on a solo mission to mine ore, shooting enemies and ultimately defeating a boss at the end of each level in order to gain experience and increase their weapon's power. Funday began developing the game after discussing Vampire Survivors with the CEO of Ghost Ship Games at the 2022 Gamescom convention. It was released into early access on Windows on February 14, 2024. As of April 2024, the full release of the game is scheduled for 2025. Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor launched in early access on February 14, 2024, and in its first week it sold over 500,000 units. In a Steam post titled ‚ÄúThe Road Ahead,‚Äù the developers expressed their gratitude to players for the game's download success. They then outlined the game's future with a ‚Äúliving roadmap‚Äù detailing upcoming updates. Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor has received very positive reviews on Steam, with players praising its engaging gameplay, familiar Deep Rock Galactic elements, and rewarding upgrade system. Players take control of a lone Dwarf miner venturing into the depths of the procedurally generated planet Hoxxes IV. The top-down perspective allows players to navigate the environment and strategically position themselves against waves of increasingly difficult enemies. Enemies drop experience gems that, when collected, progress the character's exp bar. Once the character reaches a new level, there will be a selection of upgrades that the player can choose from. Players can choose from the four familiar Dwarf classes, each offering unique gameplay styles and abilities: Each class has unique upgrade paths, allowing players to specialize in their preferred playstyle. Between waves, players access the upgrade shop, where a limited selection of upgrades is offered, adding an element of strategic resource allocation. As players gain experience through wave completion and enemy elimination, new tiers of upgrades become available within each upgrade tree, offering progressively stronger and more impactful enhancements. One of the main features of Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is the upgrade system. The player can collect ore, artifacts, and overclocks from the planet Hoxxes IV, and use them to improve their weapons and abilities. Each class has 10 weapons to choose from, each with different stats and effects. The player can also unlock and equip overclocks, which are powerful modifications that can drastically change the performance of a weapon. Additionally, the player can buy account upgrades that provide permanent benefits, such as increased health, ammo, or damage. Throughout the run, players focus on strategically eliminating enemies and gathering resources to maximize their resources and experience gain. Players have the option to choose among five different stages called biomes, with each biome offering five different hazard levels to select from, adding different challenges. Within a month of its release in early access, Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor had sold one million copies."

        "text": "Borderlands 4 is an upcoming looter shooter video game developed by Gearbox Software and published by 2K. It is a sequel to Borderlands 3 (2019) and the fifth entry in the main Borderlands series. The game is set to be released on September 12, 2025, for Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S. As with its predecessors, the game is a first-person looter shooter with elements commonly found in action role-playing games. Gearbox described the game's world as \"seamless\", and there will not be any loading screen as players explore new areas. New vehicles and transversal tools, such as a grappling hook, are introduced in Borderlands 4. The game can be played solo or cooperatively with three other players. It is planned to be the largest and most open ended game in the Borderlands series to date. Pandora's moon Elpis, after being teleported away by Lilith using her Siren powers, destroyed the protective barrier of a planet named Kairos. In Borderlands 4, players assume the role of a Vault Hunter who must lead the resistance against a ruthless dictator named the Timekeeper and his army of synthetic followers named the Order on Kairos, while searching for \"secret alien treasures\". Developer Gearbox Software began working on the game prior to the release of Borderlands 3 (2019). Gearbox described Kairos as a \"seamless\" playable space, in which players can explore various locations of interest without being interrupted by any loading screen. While the team avoided using the term \" open world \", Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford claimed that Borderlands 4 was \"the most open and free\" game in the franchise, contrasting Borderlands 3's planet-hopping structure, which resulted in a more \"compartmentalized\" design. As with its predecessors, Borderlands 4 was envisioned to be a humorous game, though the team wanted to ensure that the humor derived from emergent gameplay, in which the playable Vault Hunters will react to actions performed by players. As Borderlands 4 was set in a new planet, the game features an all-new cast. It also offered an opportunity for the art team to create landscape distinct from those on Pandora, with art director Adam May describing Kairos as a \"high-tech but lo-fi\" setting. Take-Two Interactive, following its acquisition of Gearbox from Embracer Group in March 2024, confirmed that a new title in the Borderlands series was in development. Publisher 2K officially unveiled the title in August 2024, and released its first gameplay footage at The Game Awards 2024. The game was to be released on September 23, 2025 for Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S. On April 29, 2025, citing progress on the game, Pitchford announced that Borderlands 4 would be released ahead of schedule on September 12."

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon_(2025_video_game)",
        "text": "Marathon is an upcoming first-person shooter video game developed and published by Bungie. Announced in May 2023, the game is a new entry in Bungie's original Marathon series, which began in 1994. The new Marathon is being developed as a multiplayer extraction shooter with a focus on player versus player (PvP) gameplay, and loot extraction mechanics. It is set to be released in September 2025 for PlayStation 5, Windows and Xbox Series X/S. Marathon is a first-person multiplayer extraction shooter. It is set on the planet Tau Ceti IV in the year 2893, where human colonists from the UESC Marathon, a colony ship constructed out of the Martian moon Deimos, had started a new colony. Some event caused the majority of the colonists to disappear, and the remaining survivors have formed factions to scavenge the colony for supplies. These factions have hired \"Runners\", humans who have given up their body in favor of specialized cybernetic ones, to infiltrate the colony, fight against both rival Runners and alien forces on the planet, and retrieve valuable artifacts, data, and resources. Each match centers around deploying into a shared environment, searching for loot, and attempting to successfully extract before being eliminated by enemy players or environmental threats. Gameplay is primarily focused on player-versus-player (PvP) encounters, though the game also features player-versus-environment (PvE) elements, including AI-controlled enemies and hazards. The game will feature up to six three-player teams in each match, though players can also participate as a solo or duo operatives at a competitive disadvantage. Players navigate a hostile world, balancing risk and reward. Items collected during a match are permanently lost if the player fails to extract successfully, while items collected on successful extractions can be used for future matches. Rather than a traditional single-player campaign, Marathon incorporates evolving narrative elements that are shaped by player actions and decisions over time. These changes unfold across in-game seasons and events. Players will have access to customization options, including different character builds, weapons, gear, and abilities. The game supports both solo and team-based play, with tactics and coordination being central to success. Bungie has confirmed that Marathon will include full cross-platform play and cross-save functionality across platforms. Marathon is Bungie's first major new title since becoming a subsidiary of Sony Interactive Entertainment in 2022, and its first project in over a decade following the Destiny series. Bungie revealed Marathon at the PlayStation 2023 Showcase on May 24, 2023. In August 2024, Bungie underwent a restructuring, resulting in the layoff of approximately 17% of its workforce, which impacted the development timeline of Marathon. The game has been worked on for over 4 years and with 300+ developers. According to game director Joe Ziegler, Marathon is not intended to replace Bungie's ongoing Destiny 2, which is primarily focused on player-versus-environment (PvE) rather than player-versus-player (PvP) combat. Ziegler said \"We believe that Destiny 2 has a future, and the team working on it has been working really hard to understand what players'needs are. But if you like Destiny, and you happen to like a lot of PvP sandbox experiences, and those are other games that you play, then we think that that Marathon could be something very exciting for you.\" In April 2025, Bungie launched an alternate reality game (ARG) that teased art assets and information about Marathon. Players solved the ARG to discover the date for a planned gameplay reveal livestream on April 12, 2025. In addition to the gameplay trailer, Bungie unveiled a longer narrative trailer for the game directed by Alberto Mielgo. A closed alpha test is planned from April 23, 2025; while the test was originally to require players to not disclose anything about the game under a non-disclosure agreement, Bungie lifted this restriction as they felt it was necessary to get feedback for the game. Marathon is planned for release on September 23, 2025, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, with full cross-play and cross-save support planned. The game will not require a PlayStation account for playing on Windows or Xbox systems, in contrast with several other Sony-backed games published in 2024 such as Helldivers II."

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_8020",
        "text": "Directive 8020 is an upcoming interactive drama and survival horror video game developed and published by Supermassive Games. It is the first game of the second season, and the fifth game overall in The Dark Pictures Anthology. Continuing the series'premise, the game features a cast of five playable protagonists and a multilinear narrative influenced by player choices. Its decision-making scenes can significantly alter the trajectory of the plot and change the relationships between the main characters; some can lead to the permanent death of the protagonists. In Directive 8020, a colony ship called Cassiopeia crash lands on Tau Ceti f, a planet that is 12 light-years from Earth. Lashana Lynch, who plays astronaut and pilot of the Cassiopeia, Brianna Young, is being marketed as the game's leading actress. Directive 8020 will be released for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S on 2 October 2025. Directive 8020 is an interactive drama and survival horror game presented from a third-person perspective. Player control switches between the protagonists, the crew of a colony ship called Cassiopeia, which crash lands on Tau Ceti f, a planet that is 12 light-years from Earth. The surviving crew members are scattered after being brought out of hypersleep early. Like previous games in the series, narrative choices and quick time events (QTEs) return, but Directive 8020 also includes stealth sections mixed in. The inventory system consists of tools that are linked to a \"multifunctional utility strap\" on the wrists of the characters. The strap also contains a shoulder mounted flashlight, with the enemies able to spot the beam when the light is on. Also included on the strap are a scanner that is used to spot an alien that is capable of mimicking the appearances of the crew, and a \"wedge tool\" that can be used to open a door as a last resort or to stun an enemy. Character movement has been reworked to feel \"smoother on the sticks\" according to creative director Will Doyle. Doyle also added that the game features \"stronger survival horror action adventure elements to the gameplay\". Directive 8020 is the fifth game in a series of eight planned for The Dark Pictures Anthology. It will be the first game in the anthology's second season. By mid-October 2022, the game was entering production with a lot of data already shot. The game stars Lashana Lynch as Brianna Young, an astronaut and pilot of a colony ship called Cassiopeia that crash lands on Tau Ceti f, a planet that is 12 light-years away after setting out to look for a new home to save humanity due to Earth being in the process of dying. Doyle described Directive 8020 as \" The Thing in deep space\". Doyle stated that the game also takes inspiration from other sci-fi horror films including Solaris (1972), Alien (1979), Event Horizon (1997), Pandorum (2009), Prometheus (2012), Life (2017), and Sputnik (2020). Other influences include H. P. Lovecraft's cosmic horrors. There was a NASA directive 8020.7G that was about biological contamination control for outbound and inbound planetary spacecraft. However, the directive expired in June 2022. Directive 8020 continues the trend of the anthology by casting a recognizable face as the lead character. Doyle said they were lucky to have Lynch and that she brought \"incredible power and depth\" to the role of Brianna Young. Danny Sapani plays the captain of the Cassiopeia, Commander Stafford. The soundtrack will be composed by Supermassive Games'long-time collaborator Jason Graves, who previously worked on music for the previous games in The Dark Pictures Anthology. [ better¬†source¬†needed ] Directive 8020 was first revealed in a post-credits teaser trailer at the end of The Dark Pictures Anthology: The Devil in Me, which was released on 18 November 2022. However, the trailer leaked online the day before The Devil in Me's release, revealing a sci-fi setting. On 31 December 2023, a short video teaser for the game was posted to celebrate New Year's Eve. At Gamescom in August 2024, the game was officially announced. Directive 8020 will be released for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S on 2 October 2025."

It is a standalone sequel to the 2020 game, Ghost of Tsushima. The game is scheduled to release for the PlayStation 5 on October 2, 2025. Like its predecessor, Ghost of Y≈çtei is a third-person action-adventure video game with a heavy emphasis on melee combat and open world exploration. The player character, Atsu, has access to a number of new weapon types, such as ≈çdachi, kusarigama, Tanegashima, and dual katanas, with the Kaginawa returning from Ghost of Tsushima. Atsu will also have to complete bounties to fund her journey. Developers have claimed that players will have more control over Atsu's narrative and choices compared to Ghost of Tsushima. Ghost of Y≈çtei centers around the theme of \" underdog vengeance\". The story is set in Hokkaido (then known as Ezo), Japan, in 1603, 329 years after the events of Ghost of Tsushima. Players will take control of Atsu (Erika Ishii / Fairouz Ai), a female warrior who adopts the persona of \"the Onry≈ç \" to exact revenge on the Y≈çtei Six, a group of six masked outlaws who murdered her family in her childhood, consisting of the Snake, the Oni, the Kitsune, the Spider, the Dragon, and their leader, the ruthless Lord Saito. Ghost of Y≈çtei's setting was inspired by Sucker Punch Productions's multiple visits to northern Japan. Creative director Jason Connell was struck by the beauty of Mount Y≈çtei. The development team recorded nature sounds at Shiretoko National Park. Creative director Nate Fox wanted a sequel to Ghost of Tsushima to maintain its core elements: \"transporting the player to the romance and beauty of feudal Japan \". Comparing to Ghost of Tsushima, the studio wanted to make the game world of Y≈çtei more varied, with more unique activities for players to complete. Ghost of Y≈çtei was officially revealed during PlayStation's State of Play presentation on September 24, 2024, and it was nominated for Most Anticipated Game at the Game Awards in November 2024. On April 23, 2025, it was announced that the game is scheduled to release for the PlayStation 5 on October 2, 2025."

        "text": "Vampire: The Masquerade ‚Äì Bloodlines 2 is an upcoming action role-playing video game published by Paradox Interactive. A sequel to Vampire: The Masquerade ‚Äì Bloodlines (2004), the game is part of the World of Darkness series and based on the tabletop role-playing game Vampire: The Masquerade. The game was initially developed by Hardsuit Labs, but by 2021 had been moved to The Chinese Room. It is scheduled to release for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S in October of 2025. The player takes the role of an elder vampire in 21st-century Seattle, and chooses one of several vampire clans to belong to, determining their vampiric abilities. To sustain the player character and their abilities, they feed on human characters'blood while trying to avoid being discovered as a vampire, breaking the masquerade ‚Äì the conspiracy within vampire society to hide their existence from mortals. Vampire: The Masquerade ‚Äì Bloodlines 2 is presented mainly from the first-person perspective. Before the game begins, players create a vampire character, and can select a clan background that informs their abilities. The game takes place in Seattle, where the player may explore and interact with non-player characters in a variety of ways. The player will be able to ally themselves with different factions, and deal with enemies in a variety of ways. As a vampire, the player character needs blood to survive, and can feed on humans. Players are penalized for using certain vampiric powers (called disciplines) or feeding on blood in front of witnesses, which would expose their existence as a vampire to the mortal world. This is a violation of the masquerade, and may result in changes to the gameplay. Vampire: The Masquerade ‚Äì Bloodlines 2 takes place in 21st-century Seattle. Set in the World of Darkness, the game depicts a world in which vampires, werewolves, demons, and other creatures shape human history. The vampires are bound by a code to maintain their secrecy (forbidding the use of vampiric abilities in front of humans) and avoid unnecessary killing (to preserve the vampire's last shreds of humanity). The vampires are divided into various clans with distinctive traits and abilities. The Toreador are the closest to humanity, with a passion for culture; the Ventrue are noble, powerful leaders; the Brujah are rebels who excel at fighting; the Malkavians are cursed with insanity and blessed with insight; the Gangrel are loners, in sync with their animalistic nature; the secretive, untrustworthy Tremere wield blood magic; and Nosferatu, who are condemned to a life in the shadows due to their monstrous appearance. The clans are loosely governed by the Camarilla, a cabal that enforces the vampire code and maintains the peace. Opposed to the Camarilla are the Sabbat, vampires who revel in their feral instincts and see all humans as prey, and the Anarchs, an idealistic group who disagree with the Camarilla's oligarchic political structure and believe that power should be shared by all vampires. The main character of Bloodlines 2, whom the player controls, is an elder vampire known as \"Phyre\", whose clan, appearance, backstory, and gender can be chosen by the player. It has been revealed that clans Brujah, Tremere, Banu Haqim, and Ventrue will be playable at launch. Phyre will see a three-front siege in Seattle during a historic Christmas time snow-storm. Phyre is an elder vampire, meaning one who has been turned for at least 300 years, and who is at odds with a voice inside their head, as well as with a power vacuum in Seattle's vampire court. The 2004 release of Vampire: The Masquerade ‚Äì Bloodlines had been a relative failure, selling fewer than 100,000 copies when it was launched in competition against sequels in Half-Life 2, Halo 2, and Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Bloodlines was the last in a line of games developed by Troika Games that was critically well received but marred by technical issues and low sales, and Troika was shuttered shortly after its release, preventing them from developing a sequel. In 2004, then-director Leonard Boyarsky said that although the team would like to pursue a Bloodlines sequel, the decision belonged to then-publisher Activision. Before their closure, Troika had begun development of a workable prototype based on another of White Wolf's tabletop role-playing games, Werewolf: The Apocalypse, set in the same universe as Vampire: The Masquerade. In the years following Bloodlines's release, the game became considered a cult classic, receiving over a decade of development by fans to fix technical issues and restore cut or incomplete content. Video game publisher Paradox Interactive purchased White Wolf in October 2015, obtaining the World of Darkness intellectual property, including Bloodlines. Following the purchase, Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester confirmed that a sequel was possible, stating \"when the time is right I guess a sequel will find its place in the market.\" Shortly after Paradox Interactive's acquisition of White Wolf, Seattle-based developer Hardsuit Labs pitched a Bloodlines sequel to Paradox. The Creative Director Ka'ai Cluney contacted Brian Mitsoda, who joined the sequel as the narrative lead, bringing in Cara Ellison as senior writer. Game designer Chris Avellone also served as a writer from 2016 - 2018, and Bloodlines composer Rik Schaffer returned for the sequel as the main composer. In October 2019, Hardsuit Labs publicly announced that the game was delayed to later 2020. Coinciding with the game's second delay in July 2020, Mitsoda and Cluney were both let go from their positions, as a joint decision by the leaderships at Hardsuit Labs and Paradox Interactive. Following this, Alexandre Mandryka took over the role of Creative Director. In October 2020, Paradox confirmed that Ellison had also left the project. In February 2021, Paradox Interactive announced that Hardsuit Labs was no longer working on the game, and that Paradox Interactive was collaborating with another developer to finish the production. Paradox Interactive had prior to this considered cancelling the project, but decided to continue development with a new partner and to retain much of what had been produced for it until that point. In September 2023, it was announced at PAX West that The Chinese Room had taken over development of the game, and a new trailer was shown. During the time Hardsuit Labs was working on the game, Ellison described the story and in-game factions as influenced by the conflicts over Seattle's modern identity, between its traditional music and culture and the modern developments brought by large corporations. Mitsoda said \"There's this idea of how much Seattle can change before it's no longer Seattle. So we made the factions aspects of the old and the new.\" As of September 2023, the plot of the game has changed significantly, with the player character now being an elder vampire. As the Vampire: The Masquerade tabletop game's fifth edition was in development alongside Bloodlines 2, some of Hardsuit Labs'ideas were adopted into the tabletop rules, including the concept of Resonances serving to provide enhancements. Since the announcement of The Chinese Room being the new developer on Bloodlines 2 at PAX West 2023, in September 2023, they kept its initial planned setting of Seattle. Sean Greaney, Paradox's VP of the World of Darkness franchise, noted that they \"have been able to reuse a significant amount of art and level design\" from Hardsuit's project. The Chinese Room's Studio Director Alex Skidmore clarified that they're using \"a new code base with different gameplay mechanics and RPG systems.\" Bloodlines 2 was first teased in February 2019 with the release of the dating app \"Tender\", created by Paradox and Alice & Smith. The app offered to use a \"soulmate algorithm\" and asks for the user's blood type before offering to match them with sick people nearby. A Twitch livestream, and later Paradox's own official Twitter account also displayed a memo from fictional Tender CEO Malcolm Chandler noting the need to be prepared for March 21, 2019 in San Francisco, the date the game was publicly revealed. Initially scheduled for release in March 2020, the game was pushed back in October 2019 to an unspecified 2020 release date, and further delayed in August 2020 to an unspecified 2021 release date. Along with the announcement of the change in developers in February 2021, the game was delayed past 2021. In September 2023, The Chinese Room was announced as the new developer, with the game scheduled to release for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S in late 2024. In August 2024, the game was delayed to the first half of 2025. In March 2025, Paradox delayed Bloodlines 2 to October 2025."

        "text": "171 (Um Sete Um) is an action-adventure game developed by Betagames Group, an independent team based in the state of S√£o Paulo, Brazil. It is the most popular game by Betagames.\nIt is being published by Betagames Group for Windows and by QUByte Interactive for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch. Set in the fictional city of Sumariti, based on Sumar√© in S√£o Paulo, the game revolves around Nicolau Souza, a young man with a turbulent life who gets entangled into the world of crime. The game's open world allows movement on foot or on a variety of vehicles. The game was first conceived around 2010, when Brazilian-themed mods for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas were common. Development was slow in the first years due to the small team of less than ten people working part-time on the project. Initially the Blender 3D engine was used, but in 2015 the game was re-created on Unreal Engine 4. 171 was publicly unveiled in that same year, generating great expectation in the media and being frequently nicknamed \"the Brazilian Grand Theft Auto \" thanks to its similarities with and inspiration from that famous game series. Betagames has since been releasing new development updates. In January 2019, Betagames Group received over R$ 68,000 (equivalent to US$18,378) in donations on Catarse [ pt ], a Brazilian crowdfunding platform, which contributed to its development and promotion in that year's Brasil Game Show (BGS) convention. After a pre-alpha release in March 2020, a second Catarse crowdfunding in May 2020 accumulated over R$195,000 (US$37,500). An alpha version was released in November 2022 through early access. A full release is expected for 2025. In the Brazilian Penal Code, article 171 describes the crime of estelionato (confidence trick). Therefore, in Brazilian Portuguese slang, 171 refers to a con artist, or, more broadly, a \"crook\" or criminal. Inspired by the Grand Theft Auto series, 171 is an open-world action-adventure game with role-playing and third-person shooter elements. The player controls a young criminal living in a low-income neighborhood in Brazil who can complete several gigs, both legal and illegal, purchase and use firearms, drive and steal vehicles, and commit other illicit acts such as murder and theft. The scenery is a faithful parody of real-world neighborhoods in Brazil. 171 is by Betagames Group, an independent developer team of initially ten members, localized in the state of S√£o Paulo, Brazil. In 2010 and 2011, a time when mods for games such as Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas that incorporated Brazilian elements (such as clothes, vehicles and locations) were popular, they had the idea of creating a similar game taking place in Brazil. In an interview for the website Nerd Interior, when asked \"how did you come up with the idea of an open-world game specifically set in Brazil\", Diogo Moraes, one of the developers, replied: \"It's hard to find someone nowadays who doesn't like open-world games, isn't it? We, for instance, love the freedom adopted in those games, which are true works of art plus I think, 171 is the Best game I‚Äôve developed... Seeing mods that brought Brazilian contents and even locations, despite fractioned, but more and more frequently [to video games] woke our interest and made us see the possibility of a creation focused on that goal. With time we saw that it wasn't just cool, but something that not only we, but people in general, were expecting.\" Between 2010 and 2015, the team used the Blender 3D engine, until it was replaced by Unreal Engine 4 in 2015. Development of 171 was slow in those early years. In 2015, Betagames even released another game, Minta se Puder (\"Lie if you Can\"), for Windows. A Patreon crowdfunding campaign for 171 was created that same year. As explained by Diogo Moraes, the development process is being carried out only part time: \"Even though we are an indie team that can only dedicate their free time to [the game's] development, which in fact reflects in its production time, the project remains in intense development.\" In October 2015, Betagames Group released a teaser trailer on their YouTube channel depicting 171's setting, gameplay and concept. The video obtained instant popularity in several media, including television: it appeared, for example, on the Programa do Porchat [ pt ] aired by RecordTV. The song used in the trailer was \"Chav√£o\", by Fam√≠lia Shake; Betagames Group consequently invited singers, DJs, bands and other independent artists to send their work to them so that it could be used in the game. Furthermore, the developers also invited graffiti artists to send their visual works, which they considered a form of cultural expression, giving an opportunity for less fortunate artists to get national recognition. Two days thereafter, another update, this one bringing new vehicles and weapons and changing the design of police cars, was released. \"Besides being developers, we also like to play. We know that these functions in an open-world game, like ours, must be treated with respect and attention. There's no point in creating a map as wide as an ocean but as shallow as a water pod.\" In late 2016, Betagames Group's official website released a countdown to February 2017. Many speculated that the game would be released on that date. However, it was actually the date of a major update that was later postponed to May. In the following month, the team announced their partnership with Mega Provedor, an Internet service provider located in S√£o Paulo, with the goal of allowing Betagames Group to \"support a larger amount of daily online players\", due to the large number of accesses the website was receiving. An online mode was also speculated. Finally, in May 2017, Betagames Group released another update, this one showing a gameplay experience on the expanded map. Through a partnership with YouTube channel Gigaton Games, the walkthrough had reached over 2 million views and 170,000 likes by June. The video shows the protagonist walking around the city, with several details referencing Brazilian suburbs, such as houses with unfinished walls, trash bins and painted utility poles. After another two months, another update showed the success of the social project released back in April 2016, in which several artists, including Fam√≠lia Shake, Sephion, Paradgma and Quartzo Records, sent their work to the developers. In September 2017, a YouTube channel, SanInPlay, analysed conceptual art of the game and concluded that the city in which the game would take place, up until then a secret, was based on Sumar√© in upstate S√£o Paulo, taking the fictional name Sumariti. In February 2018, another development update was released with a video showing the protagonist driving a vehicle. The process of car tuning, the HUD, and new sound and map elements were also demonstrated. In late 2018, the team released the update \"Jogar pra perder n√£o √© comigo\" (\"I do not play to lose\") which showed new gameplay features, such as shooting mechanics and vehicle destruction. They also started a crowdfunding campaign on the Brazilian platform Catarse to present a playable game in the 2019 edition of the Brasil Game Show convention, in addition to providing free giveaways and extra content to supporters. By early 2019, the campaign had already reached R$68,000, successfully enlisting 171 into that year's Brasil Game Show. On 13 April 2020, another crowdfunding campaign started on Catarse: the first goal aimed at R$57,135 (US$11,030) and the second one an additional R$21,632 (US$4,174), with both goals combined totalizing R$78,767 (US$15,204). The second part of the funding would be invested on motion capture equipment for animation improvement. The campaign was successful with the team receiving over R$30,000 (US$5,791) in the first 24 hours and the intended amount in another day, allowing for a speeding up in the game's development. In total, this second campaign received over R$197,000 (US$38,038). Betagames Group has frequently promoted 171 on YouTube, with videos showing its development process. Some gaming channels have also established partnerships with the developers to announce new updates. A crowdfunding campaign on Catarse was launched with the goal of speeding up the game's development and promoting it on Brasil Game Show (BGS) in 2019. Depending on the value donated, the supporter would receive a copy of the then upcoming pre-alpha version and some giveaways, such as a T-shirt, a mug, a poster and a sculpture of the game's protagonist. 171's promotion on BGS 2019 resulted in many news articles about the game in the Brazilian media. IGN considered 171 one of the highlights in the convention, emphasizing its visibility among the audience. About their project being nicknamed the \"Brazilian GTA \", some of the developers said: \"we don't like to call it the \"Brazilian GTA \", but they agreed that such comparison was \"inevitable\" and that they sometimes felt \"flattered\" for 171 being equated to \" Rockstar's multi-billion franchise\". The first pre-alpha version was demonstrated on Brasil Game Show in October 2019 and consisted of ten cars, two weapons and a limited part of the city map. A second development version, titled \"Pre-Alpha 2\", was released on 25 March 2020. Its release was originally predicted for late 2019, but it had to be postponed in order to provide a \"higher-quality experience to players\". This new version is available for Microsoft Windows via Steam only for those who sponsored the previous campaign on Catarse with at least R$50 and for some few media personalities intending to promote the game, such as YouTubers who had signed partnerships with the developers. Unlike the first version showcased on BGS, Pre-Alpha 2 included a \"wanted\" system similar to that of Grand Theft Auto games, in addition to voice acting in Brazilian Portuguese and the possibility of changing clothes. This version was praised mainly for its setting, vehicle gameplay and voice acting. After the release of Pre-Alpha 2, some YouTube channels and websites used the game's name for scams, claiming that it was available on other platforms (such as Android) and that there was a free version available for download, both on mobile devices and Windows. Some related that viruses capable of stealing their data entered their devices. Betagames Group and others positioned themselves against such acts and those channels were reported, with some of the videos being deleted. This, however, showed that several people were interested in obtaining the game, so Betagames Group announced that another crowdfunding campaign would be launched in the future. An alpha version was declared possible after another successful campaign on Catarse in May 2020. Predicted for the second semester of 2020, it would include new mechanics, a day-night cycle, new weapons, new vehicles (such as motorbikes), improvement of police and pedestrian AI, new movements, weapon shops, new clothes and bug fixes. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the game's production, the alpha release was postponed to 23 March 2021. After additional production problems, it was postponed again to an unspecified time, with the developers announcing that they would not set another date for the alpha before \"being fully sure of its conclusion in the best state of refinement\". After a teaser trailer on 12 October 2022, the alpha was finally released on 17 November 2022 for Windows via early access on Steam, with versions for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch predicted for a later date. On its release day, 171 Alpha was the best sold game on Steam. On 20 November, the developers were investigated after accusations of fraud and embezzlement according to a publication by a developer of the website MixMods. In the following day, Betagames published a statement defending themselves from the accusations. During the Catarse campaign of January 2019, Betagames Group commented that \"if our goals are reached, we will be able to release a beta version somewhere in 2021\". During the May 2020 campaign, the team confirmed that the beta version was still expected for 2021. After multiple delays, Betagames Group announced the cancellation of the beta in November 2024. After the alpha release, Betagames Group stated its plans to release the final version of 171 in 2024, but also commented that the date might be changed in the future. The game has also switched to using Unreal Engine 5. As of November 2024 [update], Betagames Group expects to release the final version of 171 in 2025."

        "text": "33 Immortals is an upcoming action roguelike video game developed and published by Thunder Lotus Games. The game was released for Windows and Xbox Series X and Series S through early access on March 18, 2025. 33 Immortals is an action video game played from a top-down perspective. In the game, the player assumes control of a damned soul who must fight through Hell, Purgatory and Heaven as they rebel against a cruel God who banishes them. The game supports 33-player cooperative multiplayer, and each gameplay session, which lasts around 25 minutes, is comparable to raid missions from massively multiplayer online games (MMO). Players start each session in the \"Dark Forest\", a hub world in which players can select their character archetypes (melee, ranged, support, or tank) before venturing through the Eternal Gate into the battlefield. Players are initially split into teams of six as they explore the map and completes Torture Chambers (described by the team as mini- dungeons). Once a chamber is completed, players will unlock Relics and trigger God's wrath, which causes the entire map to be engulfed in fire. The remaining surviving players are then split into three teams, with each team having one chance to complete \"Ascension Battles\", which unlock Legendary Relics that provide global bonuses to the entire team. The session will then culminate with a boss fight. Enemies placement, gameplay challenges and rewards in each session are randomly generated. The players are then returned to the Dark Forest in which they can change their loadout and interact with non-playable characters to unlock new weapons, relics and poetic perks, which typically provide stat advantages. Players can freely customize their playable avatar with various cosmetic items. The game features 14 different weapons inspired by the seven deadly sins and the seven heavenly virtues, and players must collaborate with each other to unleash \"co-op powers\", which are powerful moves that can inflict a large amount of devastating damage to enemies. If a player is defeated, other players can revive them within a set period, though the game has a set difficulty, meaning that players are more likely to complete their objectives and defeat the bosses successfully if all of their teammates survive. 33 Immortals is currently being developed by Thunder Lotus Games, the studio behind Spiritfarer. The setting of the game was inspired by The Divine Comedy, with Dante, Beatrice, Virgil, and Charon all appearing in the game as supporting characters, though their backgrounds were reworked to meet modern values. For instance, Beatrice was reimagined from a guide in Purgatory to the \"leader of the rebellion\", and Virgil becomes a female scholar who is interested in \"science, moral values, and the use of weapons\". 33 Immortals is Thunder Lotus'first online video game. To meet the challenges of developing an online game, the studio expanded into two parallel development team, and recruited personnel with prior experience working on a multiplayer project. While preparing extensively is essential for players to succeed in raid missions in other MMO games, 33 Immortals was described by the team as a \"pick up and raid\" experience, as the game streamlines the mission process and allows players to jump into action \"as quick and seamless as possible\". While the team initially experimented with having 100 players in a gameplay session, the maximum player count was reduced to 33. According to the team, 33 was chosen because each part of The Divine Comedy has 33 chapters. Thunder Lotus announced 33 Immortals in June 2023 at the Xbox Games Showcase. The game was released via early access on March 18, 2025 for Windows PC and Xbox Series X and Series S."

It is the eighth installment in the Anno series and features strategic city-building gameplay in Ancient Rome, the earliest historical setting in the franchise. For the first time, players can choose between starting provinces: ruling either the Roman Empire in Latium or the Celtic kingdom in Albion, to spread Roman or Celtic cultural influence. Players assume the role of a governor, choosing between paths of loyalty or rebellion, focusing on power or economic growth. Ubisoft officially announced the game in June 2024. It is scheduled for release in 2025 on Windows, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. Anno 117: Pax Romana is developed by Ubisoft Mainz and to be published by Ubisoft. Announced in June 2024, the game is set to be released on Windows, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S in 2025. It is the eighth installment in the Anno series and follows known strategic city-building elements. The development of the game has been subsidized by the German Federal Ministry of Economics with ‚Ç¨5.7 million since summer 2023. The game will feature the earliest historical setting in the franchise to date, transporting players to the era of Ancient Rome. For the first time in the series, players can choose between different starting provinces, ruling either the Roman Empire in Latium or the Celtic kingdom in Albion, spreading the cultural influence of the Romans or the Celts accordingly. The player will take on the role of a Governor to develop an empire and shape its future, deciding whether to achieve success through power or economic growth. The game offers two paths in terms of the role, either as loyalist or rebel. The developers also plan to focus more on diplomacy than in previous games. Its subtitle, Pax Romana, refers to a nearly 200-year period of relative peace and stability throughout the Roman Empire. The era featured a thriving economy, vast trade networks, and significant cultural and architectural achievements, many of which are still visible in Central Europe today, over 2,000 years later. This period offers a perfect setting for a game centered on trade and city-building, allowing players to step into the role of a praetor, or governor, of their chosen Roman province. In an interview with IGN, creative director Manuel Reinher stated that the team is focused on improving the starting experience for new players while maintaining the game's complexity. They plan to make the game more modular, allowing new players to choose and explore specific provinces with more context and story. Core players can still enjoy managing multiple lands and engaging in trade, as the game will be more adaptable and user-friendly. The team is committed to keeping the brand's legacy while introducing new features. The focus on fresh ideas and more social content is seen as a new way to meet player expectations. They are rebranding to expand the community and strengthen the partnership between players and developers for the best experience. The game was revealed during the Ubisoft Forward showcase in June 2024. A live-action teaser trailer was released to accompany the announcement. It features a public herald reciting Roman scripture to an empty field of sheep, which compensated for the lack of gameplay footage. The herald appeared in a second promotional video featuring 117 social media comments from people who had long wished for the Roman Empire to be the setting for the new Anno game. Several artworks were released, which, according to the developers, contain some hints about the game's content. A screenshot has been leaked after being accidentally uploaded to the official Anno site and quickly removed. The leaked image showed a large coastal settlement divided into several areas. In July 2024, Ubisoft Mainz held a contest via Anno Union in which anyone was able to design an ornament for Anno 117. A template was provided for the contest that fans could use to get creative. The silhouette of a statue needed to be completed and sent to Ubisoft. At Gamescom 2024, Ubisoft shared new details about Anno 117. The game is set to introduce significant changes to established mechanics, especially through the concept of Romanization versus Celtic traditions. Players can choose cultural paths that influence city development, production chains, and population progression."

        "text": "Cairn is an upcoming rockclimbing simulation adventure video game developed and published by The Game Bakers. The game is set to be released for Windows PC and PlayStation 5 in 2025. Cairn was described by the developer as a \"survival climber\". In the game, the player assumes control of Aava, a professional mountineer who aspire to become the first person to summit Mount Kami. Aava will discover the secrets of the mountain, and \"decide the sacrifices she is willing to make\" to achieve her dream. In the game, which is played from a third-person perspective, players are tasked to read the rock face to chart out their climbing routes. Players must manually position each of Aava's limbs as she climbs up the mountain, and unlock checkpoints through placing pitons at regular intervals. Players have to be aware of Aava's posture and manage her stamina. If Aava is placed in an uncomfortable position for sustained period of time, overextending or overexerting one limb, she may fall, partially resetting the player's progress. The game has no user interface, and players must observe Aava to gauge her level of exhaustion. If she was under extreme stress, she will breathe heavily, and her limbs will tremble. The game also features elements from survival games, as players need to rest and recover, eat and drink to lower hunger and thirst, and repair equipment following the completion of each individual ascent. In addition to the story mode, the game also features Expedition mode, in which players can choose their playable avatar (Aava or Marco), select their climbing style (alpine or free solo), and share their results with other players. Cairn is currently being developed by The Game Bakers. A team of 25 people worked on the game, and development on Cairn started in 2020. It was described by the team as the conclusion of their \"trilogy on freedom\", following Furi and Haven. The team consulted alpinist √âlisabeth Revol, who shared with the team her mountineering experience. The team compared summiting the game's mountain as a persistent boss battle, in which players use their skills and manage their resources in order to conquer it. The team compared it to Death Stranding and the Dark Souls series, though creative director Emeric Thoa stressed that Cairn was not a \"rage game\". The team also found several similarites between playing a video game and mountineering, as both had clearly defined rules and \"instinctive success and failure consequences\". Each rock face and its handholds are handcrafted by the team. Thoa added that the creating the game's technology was challenging, as the climbing movements were \"controlled by maths, not animations\", meaning that a small improvement to the level will bring about a cascade of other changes to other areas of a level. The team collaborated with Lukas Julian Lentz (known for his work on Cocoon), and Martin Stig Andersen (known for his work on Limbo and Inside) for Cairn's audio, while recruiting comic book artist Mathieu Bablet for the game's art direction and story. The Game Bakers announced Cairn in June 2024. A playable demo for the game was released through Steam in December 2024. The game is set to be released in 2025 for Windows PC and PlayStation 5."

        "text": "Cronos: The New Dawn is an upcoming 2025 survival horror game developed and published by Bloober Team. The game is scheduled to release for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S in 2025. Cronos: The New Dawn is a survival horror game played from a third-person perspective. The Traveler can used both melee abilities and a variety of firearms such as pistols and shotguns to defeat enemies. If defeated enemies are not properly disposed of using fire, a surviving enemy will merge with the undead corposes, creating a hardened, more difficult version of the same enemy. Cronos: The New Dawn follows the Traveler, who works as an agent for an enigmatic organization known as the Collective. The Traveler must survive a futuristic wasteland and travel back in time to Poland in the 1980s to extract selected people who did not survive the Change, a cataclysmic event that turned humans into monsters known as \"Orphans\". Cronos: The New Dawn is currently being developed by Bloober Team. Development of the game began in late 2021, with the team working on The Medium being assigned to work on Cronos. Bloober Team chose to make a science fiction horror game because they were also working on a remake of Silent Hill 2, which featured more grounded themes. The game features a retrofuturistic setting, with the team comparing it to Alien and the older Star Wars films. \"New Dawn\" is the starting gameplay area in Cronos, and its design was inspired by Krak√≥w during the communist rule in the 1980s. The setting was based on brutalist architecture. The team was inspired by a number of films and television series, such as 12 Monkeys, Dark, and Annihilation. Body horror inspired the game's enemy design, and The Thing was cited by the team as a source of inspiration. The team considered Cronos as a narrative-driven game, one that tells \"an intimate story about people and characters\". Following the release of The Medium, the studio wanted to pursue a larger project and move on from making adventure games to something more gameplay-focused. In 2023, Bloober Team's co-founder, Piotr Babieno, announced that the studio will stop making psychological horror games and transition to making \"mass-market horror\" games. Gameplay wise, the game was inspired by Dead Space and Alan Wake, both of which feature unique combat mechanics which encourage players to be strategic while fighting against enemies. Co-director Jacek Ziƒôba added that, in terms of gameplay, the game was \"more Resident Evil and less Silent Hill \". Private Division was originally set to publish Cronos: The New Dawn, though it dropped out of the deal in May 2024. In October 2024, the game was officially announced by Bloober Team, which will self-publish the game. It is scheduled to release for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S in 2025."

The game has a \"retro Americana\" graphical style, and involves a road trip that takes a turn into Lovecraftian horror. The main character of the game goes on a road trip to reconnect with their estranged family members, traveling between towns and doing quests in each town where they can freely walk around outside their car. The player realizes that the apocalypse is happening and must fight Lovecraftian monsters and potentially stop the end of the world. The game's creator, Mike Blackney, started development in 2014, and 6 months later, in 2015, received a $15,000 Unreal Dev Grant for the game's development. Later, he also received funding from the Australian government that enabled him to quit his job as a teacher and continue developing the game, as well as hire an artist and musician. He noted inspiration for the game from the 1981 film The Evil Dead, and horror set in the suburbs and mundane settings, and has described the game as \"Grand Theft Cthulhu\". Leena van Deventer came onto the project in 2019, as Creative Producer and Writer. In March 2023, Reuben Games announced that they intended to release the game in the third quarter of 2024. As of October 2024, Reuben Games expects to release the game in early 2025. Stephanie Chan of VentureBeat called the game \"stylish but also evocative\". Adam Smith of Rock, Paper, Shotgun called the graphics \"lovely\" and the monsters \"refreshingly untentacled\", commenting that the game could use some folklore that is not just Lovecraft."

        "text": "Drag x Drive is an upcoming 2025 sports video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch 2. The game resembles wheelchair basketball and has players compete in 3v3 matches. The game was designed to take advantage of the Joy-Con 2's mouse mode, with players using motion controls to mimic using a wheelchair to move. Drag x Drive was one of the first titles revealed for the Nintendo Switch 2 during a Nintendo Direct and is scheduled to release in Summer 2025. Drag x Drive is a sports video game centred around wheelchair basketball. The player control a robot in a wheelchair -like vehicle with the goal of shooting a basketball into the opponents basket. Matches are split between two teams of threes with the goal of scoring more points than the other team by the end of the match. The player control the robot using the Joy-Con 2's mouse mode to mimic the motions of using a wheelchair. Each Joy-Con controls one wheel; moving both Joy-Cons moves the wheelchair forward, whereas moving only one turns it. Due to the Joy-Con 2's haptic feedback, performing this motion imitates surfaces such as concrete through vibrations. Shooting the ball requires the use of motion controls, with the player required to raise their arms and flick the Joy-Cons whilst aiming at the hoop. Depending on how far the player throws the ball, the more points earned when scoring. Additionally, the player can raise their arms in order to signal teammates to pass the ball as well as clap. Players automatically grab the ball if it's on the ground, or they can ram into their opponents to make them lose control of the ball. Matches are set within dark arenas fitted with bright, neon lights. The perimeters of the basketball court are fitted with half-pipes, allowing players to perform tricks on them as well as slam dunk the ball into the hoop. Drag x Drive was first announced at the Nintendo Switch 2 direct in April 2025, with a release date scheduled for Summer 2025. According to Nintendo, Drag x Drive is expected to only be released digitally. The game was made available to play to both journalists and the public during the Nintendo Switch 2 Experience playtests between April and June 2025. Upon the announcement of the game, some critics praised the game for representing disabilities in a positive light, with Alana Hagues from Nintendo Life writing how it was a fantastic spotlight of wheelchair sports, as well as disabilities in sports as a whole, due to a lack of wheelchair sports representation within video games. However, Video Games Chronicle's Chris Scullion noted how he thought it was strange Nintendo avoided calling them wheelchairs in favour of vehicles, believing Nintendo was \"being overly squeamish about a future scandal that will never happen, instead of embracing the game‚Äôs disabled representation\". Feedback on the gameplay overall was mixed, with some journalists who attended Nintendo Switch 2 preview events recount feeling aches and pains after playing, with Hagues reporting it as \"a workout for your arms\". However, other critics responded more positively to the gameplay, with Kate Kozuch from Tom's Guide praising the controls as feeling immersive, mentioning the game having \"serious competitive potential\". Writing for Nintendojo, Robert Marrujo described the controls as feeling natural and easy to learn, noting that the controls felt \"arcade-like\". Many critics compared Drag x Drive's aesthetics and gameplay to the 2015 video game Rocket League, with GamesRadar+'s Rollin Bishop characterising the gameplay of Drag x Drive \"something akin to Rocket League combined with Wii Sports'basketball and wind-up cars \"."

Originally envisioned as a downloadable content pack to Dying Light 2: Stay Human, The Beast is set to be released for Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X and Series S in mid 2025 as a standalone game. Kyle Crane, the protagonist of the first game, returns as the protagonist of The Beast. After escaping captivity, Crane seeks revenge on the Baron, a mysterious villain who had experimented on him for 13 years. Dying Light: The Beast is an action-adventure video game played from a first-person perspective. The game is set in Castor Woods, a popular rural tourist destination overrun by zombies. Players can explore this open world using Crane's parkour skills, or driving a 4x4 vehicle. Like the first game, the zombies are slow when exposed to sunlight, but they become more aggressive and hostile at night. Crane can use a variety of melee weapons and firearms to defeat enemies. After being subjected to years of experimentation, Crane can utilize superhuman abilities, allowing him to run and sprint faster than typical human beings. He can also enter \"Beast Mode\", which allows him to launch powerful bare-handed attacks and hurl environment objects at enemies to greatly damage them. As players progress, they will be able to unlock more skills for Crane to further boost his combat prowess. As with its predecessors, the game supports 4-player cooperative multiplayer. The Beast was originally intended to be the second downloadable content pack for Dying Light 2: Stay Human. After the pack's main story was leaked by hackers in 2023, the team pivoted to turn it into a separate game. Techland described the game as a compact experience, being shorter than both Dying Light and Dying Light 2. The game also had a linear narrative, as opposed to the branching structure introduced in Dying Light 2. According to Tymon Smektala, Techland's franchise director, the decision to bring back Crane as the game's protagonist was met with enthusiasm within the studio. Crane, who was \"older, more haunted, and driven by a strong desire for revenge\", was voiced by Roger Craig Smith. Smith added that he was surprised when Techland asked him to return to the role due to the character's fate in Dying Light and its expansion, The Following. According to Techland, the game had a larger emphasis on survival when compared with Dying Light 2, with the team seeking to \"recapture\" the fear players may have experience when they first played Dying Light. Weapons and vehicles were not durable in the game, forcing players to adapt to different combat scenarios. Castor Woods was described by the team as a \"rural, forested valley\" inspired by Twin Peaks. While the natural setting provided less opportunities for players to use parkour skills for transversal, landmarks and buildings in the game were designed to ensure players must use the agility of Crane to reach their objectives. The Beast was officially announced by Techland at Gamescom 2024. The game is set to be released for Windows PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and Series S in mid 2025. Players who owned the Ultimate Edition of Dying Light 2 will receive The Beast for free, as Techland \"wanted to show appreciation for the community who patiently waited for the DLC\". The Ultimate Edition, however, was removed from sale in September 2024."

It launched in early access in January 2024 for Windows and is set to be officially released in 2025. Enshrouded is a survival action role-playing video game played from a third-person perspective. It supports up to 16 players at once. The game's world is set in Embervale, an open world which can be freely explored by players. The overworld is where players can build their bases, gather resources, and craft new equipment and gear. Players will be able to summon friendly non-playable characters to their base, who will then provide players with new crafting recipes and quests. Players can also explore areas which are covered by a thick layer of fog named \"the Shroud\". These areas are dangerous as they are filled with hostile monsters, and players can only stay within it for a limited period of time before their character dies; however, players can find valuable loot and treasure chests which regenerate regularly in the Shrouded area. Like other survival games, players need to manage their hunger and thirst level; however, hunger and thirst only affect the player character's efficiency in combat. Drinking water boosts the player's endurance, while eating food boosts their constitution. Enshrouded also has a sleep mechanic. Players can use a variety of weapons to defeat enemies, and they can dodge and parry hostile attacks. As players progress in the game, they will unlock new talents, further boosting their combat capabilities and allowing players to specialize in one of three Archetypes: Melee Focused, Magic Focused, and Ranged Focus. Each archetype has four specialties such as Barbarian, Wizard, or Hunter. They will unlock a glider and a grappling hook, both of which aid their traversal in the game's world. If the player character dies in the game, players will keep all of their equipped gear and crafted items, and only lose all of the raw resources they have collected. Enshrouded is being developed and published by German studio Keen Games, which previously developed Portal Knights. The developers drew inspirations from games such as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Valheim. While the combat was influenced by \" Soulsborne \" games, it was not designed to be as challenging. It was envisioned as a \"welcoming\" game for players who are unfamiliar with the survival game genre. Keen announced the game in May 2023. An eight-hour demo for the game was released during Steam Next Fest in November 2023. Enshrouded was released via Steam's early access model on January 24, 2024. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Series S versions are also currently in development. The full release of the game is scheduled for 2025. Enshrouded sold over one million copies within a week of its early access launch."

Set in the fictional city of Eriksholm, the game follows Hanna‚Äîa young orphan whose brother, Herman, disappears‚Äîas she embarks on a quest to uncover the truth behind his disappearance. Featuring isometric gameplay, the player can choose from three playable characters, including Hanna, as they explore the city, complete objectives and puzzles, and employ stealth to evade enemies. The game's setting is inspired by early-20th-century Scandinavian cities and architecture. Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream is scheduled to release for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S in 2025. Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream is an adventure stealth game with an isometric view that allows the player to freely move the camera to survey the environment. Initially, the game features one playable character ‚Äîa young orphan named Hanna, who embarks on a quest to find her missing brother, Herman, in the fictional city of Eriksholm. As the story progresses, two additional characters‚ÄîAlva and Sebastian, who assist Hanna on her journey‚Äîbecome playable. Afterwards, the player can swap between characters at any time and use them together to complete objectives, which may have multiple solutions, and solve puzzles. Each character has unique skills, tools, and weapons; for example, Hanna can crawl through vents, Alva can climb drain pipes, and Sebastian can swim. The player uses stealth to evade enemies, and if a character is spotted, the game restarts shortly before that moment. Levels can be explored repeatedly, with collectibles to find and various paths and methods available for each character. Set in the fictional city of Eriksholm, the game follows a young orphan Hanna, whose brother Herman disappears after stealing a valuable item, prompting a police pursuit. Hanna enlists the help of Alva and Sebastian and embarks on a quest to uncover the truth behind Herman's disappearance, as events transforms them into symbols of change. Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream is developed by River End Games, a studio consisting of up to 19 members, including veteran AAA developers who previously worked on Battlefield, Little Nightmares, Mirror's Edge, and Unravel. The game's setting is inspired by early-20th-century Scandinavian cities and architecture, notably Gothenburg ‚Äîwhere the studio is based‚Äîas well as Stockholm and Malm√∂, Sweden. Initially, the developers established the game's backstory and populated it with characters; subsequently, they selected their favorite characters and developed individual narratives for them. When the studio began pre-production, it planned to use either Unreal Engine 5 or Unity. However, since Unity had not yet implemented physically based rendering at that moment, River End felt that Unreal Engine would be the \"natural choice\". Initially, the team employed proprietary face-scanning technology that produced \"really good\" results, although the process was described as \"very slow and tedious\". Eventually, the developers adopted Epic Games'MetaHuman technology to transfer actors'facial performances to character models, deeming it \"an extremely useful tool\" for their small team. For performance reasons, the studio used \"baked lighting\" while relying on Unreal Engine's Lumen lighting technology for pre-rendered cutscenes. Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream was announced at the Future Games Show in June 2024. It is scheduled to release for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S in 2025."

It is scheduled to be released in the third quarter of 2025 for Windows via Steam, with a possible console release. The game is set 65 million years in the future, where life on Earth's surface has gone extinct due to an ice age called the Everwinter. Birds have evolved into the Tuai, a hyper-intelligent underwater race that combines both avian and dinosaur traits. Now dependent on the icy climate for survival, the main character fights against enemies that threaten to end the Everwinter. The game contains real-time underwater combat in the manner of a character action game, with the player character possessing heat and cold abilities. Jordan Devore of Destructoid stated that he had never seen anything like Glaciered, calling it a \"a stylish character action game with slick-looking ranged and melee attacks\", but set underwater on a frozen-over planet. Saying that he was \"hooked on the *idea* of Glaciered \", he noted that it \"simply looks like something I'd enjoy playing\", and that he would be keeping tabs on the game. Rick Lane of PC Gamer had initially believed the game would be similar to Abz√ª, saying it started out \"beautiful, charming and relaxing\", but was subsequently surprised by its action elements, which he likened to Bayonetta. Calling the game's premise \"delightfully absurd\", he praised the fights with giant creatures, saying \"it's utterly daft and I am extremely here for it\". Digitally Downloaded remarked that the game had \"the potential to break the mould of this genre of Japanese indie action adventures\". Jasmine Beverungen of GamePro stated that the game combined aspects of exploration games with fast-paced combat and appealed to her interest in games with a dark, apocalyptic atmosphere, and that she wanted to know more about the setting."

        "text": "Gothic: Remake is an upcoming 2025 action role-playing game developed by Alkimia Interactive and published by THQ Nordic. It is a remake of Piranha Bytes'2001 video game of the same name. The game is scheduled to release for Windows, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in 2025. In May 2019, the Austrian computer game publisher THQ Nordic bought the German development studio Piranha Bytes, which were the creators and owners of the Gothic series. This title and ownership passed to THQ Nordic. In December 2019, the Spanish branch of THQ Nordic, THQ Barcelona, released the game demo Gothic Playable Teaser and at the same time started a public survey to get feedback from the fan community on the demo and on the idea of a remake. The response to it was relatively high, with over 180,000 downloads of the demo and over 30,000 responses, which varied accordingly. In February 2020, THQ Nordic announced the production of the remake. According to the publisher, over 90% of the players were in favor for a production of a remake. Aside from certain graphics taken from the playable teaser, there was a \"complete reboot\" in game design, after the community feedback on the demo called for a remake that was more close to the original than the demo itself. Before the start of production, in March 2021, Alkimia Interactive was founded in Barcelona specifically for the development of a Gothic remake. All creative people involved were advised to have played the original title before the start of production. Piranha Bytes itself had stated to THQ Nordic that its own motivation in game development was not another Gothic game, but the development of other titles such as ELEX. But as a result of the closure of Piranha Bytes in Winter 23/24, some employees of that team joined the studio Alkimia Interactive and thus the production of the remake. By their own admission, the \"heart\" that Alkimia Interactive is focusing on in production is the AI. An algorithm in the game decides which animation sequences are called up or follow one another, so that the movements of the player character (the \"nameless hero\") and NPCs appear realistic. The algorithm/the AI uses 20‚Äì30-minute motion capture recordings as specifications, which have been divided into individual sequences and categorized, which is referred to as motion magic. According to the developers iteration has been given a lot of work-time during the production in this regard. \"Controls and UI \" are also \"two big points\" to make the game \"more accessible [than the original]\". According to Reinhard Pollice, the lead producer at Alkimia Interactive, the combat system in the remake is based on the original, in contrast to the playable teaser. The skill system will again be \"very close to the original\", too. True to the 2001 game, the nameless hero also starts untrained, without any skills. Lockpicking will feature a system similar to the original, but will be, according to Alkimia Interactive, presented differently. Due to increased design options and higher level of detail since 2001, the game world, which is based on the original, will be 10‚Äì30% larger overall. As some places in the original game world were not fully designed, an attempt was made to \"take up such potential\". Ideas that Piranha Bytes could not implement during the development of the original, due to a lack of budget and time, were taken up. Because of this, some locations have higher magnification than others. Through those few new locations the remake has got additional quests, which are based on the camp affiliation, because the original lacks such quests later in the game. Puzzles have been revised to include \"new interactions\". \"Plotholes\" of the original would be \"better explained\" in the remake. One narrative difference is that the remake offers more content and lore about the orcs and their culture, and that the player can decide how his general stance towards them is. Other innovations compared to the original are the adjustability of the camera angle of the third-person perspective and the possibility to adjust the balance/difficulty. Has it taken at least 23 hours and 38 hours at max. to beat the original, the playtime of the remake can be about 10 hours (according to other statements up to 20 hours) longer. However, this applies to one playthrough. Due to the additional camp-specific quests of the three factions, the remake has a total of at least 30 hours of additional content. Alkimia Interactive had in 2023 approximately 45 and in 2024 over 50 employees working on the production of the remake. The THQ studio Gate21, based in Sarajevo, was commissioned to design armor and NPCs. In contrast to the predecessor, the armor of the NPCs will not look exactly the same, but will differ in details, so that there will be variations from each armor model. In the remake, the \"hero\" (player character) is able to tweak the value of his armor through modifications, which in turn has a small impact on the appearance of the armor. The weaponsmithing and food- and cooking system have been expanded for the remake. In order to facilitate and speed up the work process, the faces of NPC were created with deep learning AI. The development of those faces was a multi-year process, at the beginning of which the faces were designed manually. To avoid having repetitive faces (as was the case in the original) with around 600 NPCs in the game, the developers morphed face models together to create new faces. The game is developed with the Unreal Engine for organizational reasons. During development, Alkimia Interactive switched from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5. When asked whether there will be mod support for the remake, the development studio, which itself consists of members (e.g. Lead Producer Pollice) who had worked on mods for Gothic I and Gothic II, explained that they will \"hand out some kind of scripting language\", as the Unreal Engine is \"not ideal for modding\". Kai Rosenkranz, who was already the composer of the eponymous original, is also responsible for the soundtrack of the remake. Rosenkranz reinterprets the original soundtrack and adds additional pieces of music. The Dialogues from the original are sometimes adapted and new written dialogues will be added to the remake, too. As in the original, the choice of a dialogue-option can often determine the course and outcome of a conversation. The game will be voiced in German and English, and due to its large fanbases in Poland and Russia, in Polish and Russian, too. Text based localizations for Chinese, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean and Spanish are also planned. When dubbing the German edition, Alkimia Interactive included voice actors who were involved in the original, if voices havent changed or aged too much. A first trailer was released in August 2022. Artworks and screenshots of the remake get published on Steam at regular intervals since January 2023 at the latest. A second trailer was published in August 2023. A year later a third trailer, containing ingame scenes, was released. In the same month, August 2024, a demo was presented at Gamescom, which differs from the finished remake in terms of gameplay and setting (e.g. no quick save mode, different player character). As part of the Steam Next Fest 2025 said Demo titled ‚ÄûNyras Prologue‚Äú, is available on Steam from 24th February to 3rd March 2025. There will be a Standard Edition and a Collector's Edition as retail versions. While the standard edition only contains the game, the collectors edition, which is limited to 7,500 copies, includes the game on DVD, a wall decoration (a so-called sleeper mask with a wall mount), a notebook and a bracelet, each made of real leather, and the game's soundtrack on CD. In February 2023, Alkimia Interactive claimed the development was \"in the middle of production and therefore perfectly on schedule\", but did not want to commit to a release date. In March 2023, the studio cited the year 2024 as a \"realistic release timeline.\" In the same month, publisher THQ Nordic said it \"did not want to name a final release period\". By August 2023, it was planned for release in the second half of 2024. After Gamescom, it was reported in September 2024 that the release could also take place in the first quarter of 2025. At the end of 2024, it was reported that the remake would most likely be released in 2025, but could also be released in the first quarter of 2026."

It is due to be the eighth main Grand Theft Auto game, following Grand Theft Auto V (2013), and the sixteenth entry overall. Set within an open world ‚Äîthe fictional U.S. state of Leonida, based on Florida ‚Äîand its Miami -inspired Vice City, the story is expected to follow the criminal duo of Lucia and her male partner. Following years of speculation and anticipation, Rockstar confirmed in February 2022 that the game was in development. That September, footage from unfinished versions was leaked on the internet in what journalists described as one of the biggest leaks in the history of the video game industry. The game was formally revealed in December 2023 and is scheduled to be released in late 2025 for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series¬†X/S. Grand Theft Auto VI is set in the fictional open world U.S. state of Leonida‚Äîbased on Florida ‚Äîwhich includes Vice City, a fictionalised version of Miami. Vice City was previously featured in Grand Theft Auto (1997) and as the main setting of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (2002) and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories (2006). The game world parodies contemporary American culture, with satirical depictions of social media and influencer culture, and references to Internet memes such as Florida Man. The story follows a criminal duo: Lucia, the series's first female protagonist since 2000, and her male partner; the first trailer depicts Lucia as a prison inmate, and later evading custody with her partner. Rockstar Games began preliminary work on Grand Theft Auto VI in 2014 after Grand Theft Auto V's release, and principal development started after Red Dead Redemption 2's release in 2018. During its production, the game was code-named Project Americas. Jason Schreier reported the game was \"a moderately sized release\" that would expand over time to avoid its predecessors'developer crunch, and that it would feature two Bonnie and Clyde ‚Äìinspired protagonists, including a Latina woman, and \"a significant online mode\" akin to Grand Theft Auto Online. He claimed the developers were cautiously subverting the series's trend of joking about marginalised groups. In 2018, The Know reported that the game would be set primarily in Vice City and partly in South America, and in 2021, Tom Henderson claimed its map could evolve akin to Fortnite. The game became highly anticipated in the years before its announcement, and journalists noted some fans became frustrated by Rockstar's continued silence, particularly after they announced a re-release of Grand Theft Auto V in 2020. An individual referencing the game received media attention for interrupting several live stage and television shows. On 4 February 2022, Rockstar confirmed development was \"well underway\". In July, Rockstar announced Red Dead Online would not receive more major updates as development resources were withdrawn to focus on the upcoming game; industry sources stated Rockstar reallocated resources after planned remasters of Grand Theft Auto IV (2008) and Red Dead Redemption (2010) were paused due to the backlash received by Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy ‚Äì The Definitive Edition (2021). Schreier reported in February 2024 that Rockstar requested employees cease remote work and return to offices full time from April \"for productivity and security\" as development entered its \"final stages\". The Independent Workers'Union of Great Britain criticised Rockstar for contradicting their promise to maintain flexible working conditions; some employees were concerned it could negatively impact staff health and morale and prompt resignations and crunch conditions. In March, Kotaku's Zack Zwiezen reported the decision was partly to avoid a delay from the internally scheduled early 2025 release window; development \"falling behind\" meant late 2025 seemed more practical, with a potential delay to 2026 as a \"fallback plan\". Rockstar's parent company Take-Two Interactive's share price dropped by more than five per cent, though other journalists refuted the report and said the game remained \"on schedule\". In May, Take-Two confirmed the game was scheduled for the third or fourth quarter of 2025. Anticipation surrounding the game spawned an internet meme indicating bemusement that other surprising events occurred \" before GTA 6 \". It won Most Wanted Game at the Golden Joystick Awards and Most Anticipated Game at the Game Awards in 2024. Several publishers are awaiting a release date announcement before scheduling their own games, with others prepared to reschedule to avoid potential competition with Grand Theft Auto VI. Some are hoping it is sold for US$80 to $100‚Äîmore than the standard $70‚Äîas it would prompt industry-wide changes, but analysts consider it unlikely. The research firm Circana predicted the launches of Grand Theft Auto VI and the Nintendo Switch¬†2 could allow the video game market to \"rebound\" with record consumer spending in 2025; DFC Intelligence projected sales of 40¬†million and earnings of $3.2¬†billion in the first year‚Äîtwice as much as Grand Theft Auto V ‚Äîincluding $1¬†billion in preorders. In November 2023, Sam Houser, the president of Rockstar Games, announced the first trailer would release in early December to celebrate the company's 25th anniversary. Within five hours, the announcement on X (formerly Twitter) surpassed two previous posts about the game to become the platform's most- liked gaming-related post, later surpassed by Rockstar's post announcing the trailer's 5 December release date, with 1.8¬†million likes in 24 hours. Other developers imitated the announcement's formatting to promote their trailers. On 4 December, a low-quality version of the trailer was leaked on X; in response, Rockstar published the official version on YouTube, revealing the title, protagonists, setting, and release window of 2025 for the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X and Series S. The trailer broke the record for most first-day views on a non-music YouTube video within 12 hours, with 46 million, and, within 24 hours, became the third-most-viewed overall, with 93¬†million, and most-liked game trailer, with 8.9¬†million. It surpassed the lifetime viewership of Grand Theft Auto V's 2011 reveal trailer within two days, with 101¬†million views, and became the second-most-viewed game trailer by January, with 168¬†million. Its featured song, Tom Petty's \" Love Is a Long Road \", saw a near-37,000 per cent increase in Spotify streams, had almost 250,000 searches on Shazam, and ranked second on the worldwide iTunes chart. The trailer spawned fan-created recreations in other video games, as a brickfilm, and in live-action by the Hyundai World Rally Team. On 18 September 2022, a user known as \"teapotuberhacker\" published 90 videos to the website GTAForums showing 50 minutes of work-in-progress game footage. Schreier confirmed with sources at Rockstar that the footage was genuine, and The Guardian reported it was from several stages of development, with some videos about a year old. The footage revealed a modern-day Vice City setting, contained animation and gameplay tests, level layouts, and character conversations, and depicted the player characters, Lucia and Jason, entering a strip club and robbing a diner. The hacker claimed to be responsible for the Uber security breach from the prior week, said they had downloaded the files directly from Rockstar's internal Slack groups, and claimed to possess source code, assets, and internal builds of Grand Theft Auto V and VI, which they threatened to publish. Take-Two responded by submitting takedowns of videos showing or discussing the leaks hosted on YouTube, and contacted GTAForums and Reddit moderators to remove access. The hacker wrote they were \"looking to negotiate a deal\" with Rockstar or Take-Two. Journalists described the event as one of the biggest leaks in video game history; Schreier called it \"a nightmare for Rockstar Games\" which could limit employees'remote-work flexibility. The Jefferies Group analyst Andrew Uerkwitz called it a \"PR disaster\" that could potentially delay the game and diminish staff morale, but was unlikely to impact reception or sales. The Guardian noted the leaked footage was being widely criticised \"by ill-informed users\" due to its quality, despite not being representative of the final product. Some users erroneously claimed graphics and art assets are finalised early in game development. In solidarity, several developers shared work-in-progress footage of their games and some, including Cliff Bleszinski, Neil Druckmann, Rami Ismail, and Alanah Pearce, offered sympathies to Rockstar. On 19 September, Rockstar confirmed the leak to be a \"network intrusion\" and lamented the manner in which the game was first demonstrated, but did not anticipate long-term effects on development. They disabled comments and replies on their social media accounts in the days following the leak. Take-Two added that steps had been taken \"to isolate and contain this incident\". Take-Two's share price dropped by more than six per cent in pre-market trading that day, but recovered during regular trading hours following their statement. Uber acknowledged the potential links to their security breach and noted they were working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Department of Justice. They believed the hacker was affiliated with the group Lapsus$, which was thought to have breached companies such as Microsoft, Nvidia, and Samsung over the preceding year. Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two's chairman and chief executive officer, said the incident caused the companies to become more vigilant with cybersecurity and had impacted staff emotionally but business remained unaffected. Rockstar later claimed the incident cost the company $5 million and thousands of staff hours to recover. A 17-year-old boy from Oxfordshire ‚Äîidentified as \"teapotuberhacker\" and a key member of Lapsus$‚Äîwas arrested by the City of London Police on 22¬†September as part of an investigation supported by the National Cyber Crime Unit and American federal law enforcement. While on bail for hacking EE and Nvidia and under police protection at a Travelodge hotel, he breached Rockstar using a mobile phone, television, and an Amazon Fire TV Stick and threatened to release the source code in a Slack message to all Rockstar staff. Appearing before Highbury Corner Youth Court, he pleaded guilty to two counts of breaching bail conditions and not guilty to two counts of computer misuse. The case was referred to a higher court while the boy was remanded to a youth detention centre. In mid-2023, he stood trial at Southwark Crown Court for twelve offences, including six counts of computer misuse, three of blackmail, and two of fraud. He was deemed unfit to stand trial due to his autism; instead of assessing his guilt, a jury determined he had committed the acts. A judge placed him under an indefinite hospital order in December for being a high public risk as he expressed an intent to continue committing cybercrimes. On 1 January 2025, a Reddit user posted a photograph and two videos of a PlayStation 5 development kit running the game, taken by a person who \"worked at the Rockstar office for a few months\" in mid-2021; the post was later deleted. Based on the office's surroundings, Eurogamer determined the photograph and videos were taken at Rockstar San Diego. Polygon's Ian Walker found no new information was revealed from the post, which he called the \"worst leak of all time\"."

        "text": "GreedFall 2: The Dying World is an upcoming action role-playing video game developed by Spiders and published by Nacon. A prequel to GreedFall (2019), the game was released via early access in September 2024. The game is set to be released in full in 2025 for Windows, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and Series S. GreedFall 2 is an action role-playing video game played from a third-person perspective. The player assumes control of a member of an indigenous tribe on the island of Teer Fradee, who is abducted by forces of the mainland who seeks to colonize the island. The game is set in the continent of Gacane, an open world which can be freely explored. The game features a character creator, allowing players to customize the appearance of their player avatar. Players can use a variety of ways to approach their objectives: they can engage with direct combat with their enemies, sneak past them using stealth tactics, or negotiate with other non-playable characters using the player character's skills in diplomacy. The game's combat occurs in real-time, though players can tempoarily halt the action to issue commands to the player character and their compansions. Players can assume direct control of the companion characters and freely switch between them in GreedFall 2 during combat. Different characters have distinct skills. Some are more skilled in melee combat, while some are more observant, allowing them to discern traps from a distance. GreedFall 2 was developed by Spiders by a team of less than 100 people. As the original game was a commercial success for the studio, Spiders listened to player's feedback and incorporate changes such as deepening the lore of the game, and introducing an explorable setting that was only hinted at in the first game. GreedFall 2 flips the narrative of the first game and its story sees an islander venturing into the mainland. Jehanne Rousseau, lead writer of the game, described the setting as a fantasy world that was also \"based on history\". She added that GreedFall 2 tells \"a story about political schemes and murders\", and that the world was \"more dirty than heroic\". According to art director Cyril Tahmassebi, the team also wanted to improve the \" Rembrandt -inspired art design and golden century feel\" of the first game, and the expanded setting allowed the team to create more factions and locations. The team also completely revamped the combat system in an effort to make party members more involved. As opposed to the first game in which companions are controlled by artificial intelligence, players can directly issue commands to companions in GreedFall 2 so that players can feel like they were controlling a team of characters. The game was heavily inspired by BioWare's Dragon Age: Origins and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, and the team spent an extensive amount of time developing the game's companion characters. Publisher Nacon and Spiders announced the game in May 2022. The early access version of the game, which includes the first chapter of the game, was released for Windows on September 24, 2024. The full version of the game, as well as versions for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Series S, will be released in 2025."

        "text": "Hollow Knight: Silksong is an upcoming 2025 Metroidvania video game developed by Australian independent developer Team Cherry. The sequel to Hollow Knight, it is being developed for Linux, macOS, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. Silksong was originally conceived as downloadable content for Hollow Knight, but the scope of the project grew enough that Team Cherry announced it as a separate sequel in February 2019. Hollow Knight: Silksong gameplay is set to be similar to its predecessor Hollow Knight, featuring 2D platforming and combat. Some changes are made from the original, such as the player character moving with a more acrobatic flair or applying instant self-healing. Side-quests will be part of the game, and include a journal to keep track of them. This includes a quest system divided into four categories titled Gather, Wayfarer, Hunt, and Grand Hunt, which are provided by the non-player characters in the game or by quest boards. Team Cherry stated Silksong to be very large, featuring at least 165 new enemies and over 100 different checkpoints (\"benches\") throughout the game world, compared to 51 in Hollow Knight. Hornet is captured and taken to the unknown kingdom of Pharloom, which is said to be \"haunted by Silk and Song\", and must climb to the top to reach a shining citadel. Hollow Knight: Silksong was announced on 14 February 2019 in a trailer and with a developer diary video sharing more information. Since the announcement, per GameSpot, \"updates have been sporadic and infrequent\". Eventually, due to the increased scope of the project, Team Cherry decided to expand the downloadable content to a full sequel. The developers released an update in March 2019, sharing descriptions and images of characters who will appear in Silksong. They thanked the game's fans for supporting them regarding the announcement of the sequel. In December 2019, Team Cherry released a preview of the soundtrack, composed by Christopher Larkin, as well as an update on the total number of enemies developed, with a focus on a trio, described as \"members of a scholarly suite.\" An article in PC Gamer from February 2022 showcased Team Cherry co-director William Pellen stating that the game was still in development despite the lack of updates since December 2019 and said that more details would be revealed as the game got closer to its release. A new trailer was revealed at the Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase in June 2022, revealing that Silksong would be released on Xbox Game Pass at launch, with the game being available through the service for PC and Xbox Series X/S. While no release date was announced, the Xbox Twitter account stated in a tweet that it would be available within the next twelve months, implying they expected a release by 12 June 2023. In September 2022, Sony confirmed in a separate tweet that the game would also come to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. Team Cherry marketing and publishing representative Matthew Griffin declared on 10 May 2023 that the game was delayed, stating \"We had planned to release in the first half of 2023, but development is still continuing.\" In August 2024, Geoff Keighley posted on X (formerly Twitter), days before the Gamescom Opening Night Live: \"Just to get this out of the way, no Silksong on Tuesday at ONL. @TeamCherryGames is still cooking.\" In January 2025, in response to rumors online, Griffin said that the game was still in active development, was still planned for release, On April 2, during the Nintendo Direct on the new Nintendo Switch 2 system, Silksong was presented in a sizzle reel for a 2025 release date. In May 2022, Hollow Knight: Silksong won a \"Most Anticipated Game\" award from Unity. In response, Team Cherry thanked the community for their support and said \"It can't be too much longer, surely!\" Silksong won the same award again in 2024, this time without any official acknowledgment."

The game was released in early access on November 15, 2024. Upon its initial announcement, IGN compared the game to the 2023 horror film, Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey, due to a similar situation where Winnie-the-Pooh fell into the public domain. The game was immediately criticized as an asset flip, and for its alleged use of audio deepfakes instead of voice acting. It was criticized for neo-Nazi themes such as the number 88, and the premise of using gas to exterminate rats. In response to the allegations, the developers renamed the game."

        "text": "Instinction is an upcoming action-adventure video game developed and published by Hashbane Interactive, based in New Zealand. Inspired by the Dino Crisis game series, development began around early 2020. It was originally scheduled for release in September 2022, although additional project financing helped fund a larger development team to expand the game, with the release pushed to 2025. It will be released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. Instinction is an action-adventure game. Much of the game is set in the Valley of the Rift, where past and present timelines collide. Hidden within the Yucat√°n Peninsula, the valley is home to dinosaurs that co-exist with an ancient civilization of humans, who work to protect the area and its creatures. The player takes control of Isabel Sierra, a young Mexican-American ecologist. Isabel's grandmother, born within the peninsula, becomes terminally ill and requests that Isabel travel there to return a heirloom belonging to her indigenous people. Meanwhile, an organization descends upon the area and its inhabitants, claiming that its reason for being there is to stop a natural disaster. In addition to single-player, the game will also include a cooperative mode for up to three players. It is played from first- and third-person perspectives. Set in an open world, the game will feature changing weather and a variety of locations, including forests, temples, and scientific research facilities. The game will initially feature more than 25 prehistoric creatures, including Smilodon, Kronosaurus, Homo floresiensis, and various dinosaurs such as Carnotaurus. Additional prehistoric creatures will be added through downloadable content, with fan suggestions being taken into consideration. The game will include various weapons, and in addition to shooting enemies, it will also encourage exploration and puzzle-solving. Aside from main objectives, the player will also have side missions to complete, such as collecting ancient artifacts. The game will have an array of customisation options relating to weapons, player skins, and the heads-up display. Instinction is in development by Hashbane Interactive, based in New Zealand. The company was formed by employees of the design firm Dane Design. Several employees at the firm were fans of the Dino Crisis games. As a hobby, they began working on a dinosaur video game with Unreal Engine, which the firm had been using since 2015 to design 3D buildings. A working prototype of the game was finished with a week, and the results prompted the team to pursue development of a full game through the formation of Hashbane. The game is being developed with Unreal Engine 5, and it will incorporate ray tracing and DLSS. For years, fans had wanted Capcom to revive the Dino Crisis series or remake the original game. The series, dormant since 2003, was the primary inspiration for Instinction. It is viewed as a spiritual successor with modernized gameplay, while lacking the series'fixed camera angles. The development team was also inspired by other game series such as Turok, Tomb Raider, Metal Gear, and Uncharted, as well as the video games Trespasser (1998) and Alien: Isolation (2014). Despite these sources of inspiration, Hashbane co-founder and chief operating officer Courtney O'Neill said Instinction \"is not a replacement or clone of anything\". The development team consulted with paleontologists for advice on the game's dinosaurs. O'Neill said, \"While some may just be interested in a cool dinosaur game, realism is just more powerful and fulfilling, and more difficult\". Some artistic license will be retained wherever it benefits the game. The team amassed a collection of bird sounds from around the world and then modified them to create the dinosaur sound effects. For the game's environments, the team conducted extensive research on climate, plant species, and different types of rocks. After roughly a year of development, Instinction was announced in February 2021. Several trailers were unveiled later that year. Instinction was originally scheduled for release in September 2022. The project was initially self-financed. Additional funding came in early 2022, from New Zealand investment company Hillfarrance, allowing Hashbane to expand its development team and create a superior game compared to what was previously planned. All of the work prior to that point will be revamped. New members of the development team included Sanjay Singh, an artist of creature models and sculptures on the 2022 series Prehistoric Planet. Game writer Cameron Suey also joined the project. As a result of the new funding and development work, the game's release was pushed to 2025. It will be released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. It had also been planned for Google Stadia, until Google announced it was shutting down the service. Instinction was scheduled to receive an early access release through Steam during the second half of 2023."

A successor to Killing Floor 2 (2016), the game is scheduled for release in 2025 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Series S. Killing Floor 3 is a first-person survival horror. In the game, which supports both solo play and four-player cooperative multiplayer, players must defeat waves of zombie -like bioengineered creatures known as \"Zeds\". The number of enemies appearing in each match is adjusted to the size of the player's team. The game features a hub space known as the Stronghold where players can choose their playable character and mission location before a match commences. The game features six different specialists, with each having their own unique weapons and special attacks. For instance, the Ninja specialist wields a pair of swords, and uses a grappling hook that can pull them towards an enemy. As players accumulate Zed kills, they can also trigger \"Zed Time\", which briefly slows down time and highlights all nearby enemies. In between rounds, players can stock up on ammo and other resources, as well as using the Multi-tool to activate devices such as sentry guns or ziplines. As players complete matches, they will be able to customize their weapon with new mods, and unlock new skills for their specialists. During each match, players can also complete optional narrative assignments which expand the story and the world of Killing Floor. Tripwire Interactive led the game's development. Creative director Bryan Wynia described Killing Floor 3 as the \"direct sequel\" to the first game, with the team aiming to recapture its \"darker, grittier tone\". Despite its sci-fi setting, the game was designed to be grounded, and that the game will not feature any outlandish weapons or gadgets. Player movement was overhauled, with players now being able to perform feats such as climbing onto ledges, dodging, and sliding. Wynia added that the team reduced the number of Zeds in each match and slow down the pace of combat when compared with previous games, all enemies, including the basic ones, are more dangerous as they are equipped with new skills and movement options. Due to the increased mobility of both the player character and the Zeds, maps were designed to be more vertical in nature. The M.E.A.T. (massive evisceration and trauma) system, introduced in the previous game, returned in Killing Floor 3 to depict dynamic gore and detailed graphic violence. According to Wynia, the body horror genre, such as The Thing, inspired the game's enemy design, while Aliens vs. Predators influenced its overall look and feel. Tripwire Interactive announced Killing Floor 3 at Gamescom in August 2023. A closed multiplayer beta was released in January 2025. The game was originally set to be released on March 25 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and Series S, but was delayed for a general 2025 release window instead. At launch, the game will have seven maps, three difficulty modes, and three boss encounters, as well as 30 upgradable levels for each specialist."

It serves as a stand-alone sequel to the first two Little Nightmares games. The game follows two new child protagonists, Low and Alone, as they navigate through The Nowhere and escape from a looming threat. It is scheduled for a 2025 release. What can be seen of the narrative thus far follows two new characters, \"Low\" and \"Alone,\" journeying through \"the Nowhere,\" (similarly to its predecessors, Little Nightmares and Little Nightmares II), a desolate and nightmarish realm that can only be accessed through sleeping. There were a variety of locations shown in the trailer for the game, which imply that the protagonists will be entering and exploring many new and heavily distinctly themed areas. There are many extremely hostile beings that reside in the Nowhere and often attempt to capture, kill, or generally harm the protagonists, which provides a prominent element of survival to the gameplay and narrative of Little Nightmares III. It is implied that, like the protagonists of the previous games, Low and Alone do not reside in the Nowhere willingly and have a long-term goal of escaping it. Like its predecessors, the player explores a 2.5D world, encountering platforming situations and puzzles that must be solved to proceed. Unlike the first two games, the player can now go solo alongside an AI companion or with another player in online co-op. The two main characters have different gameplay mechanics, with Low wielding his bow and arrow, and Alone using her wrench. In 2021, Tarsier Studios confirmed that Little Nightmares II would be its last entry as they were acquired by Embracer Group in December 2019; but since the Little Nightmares intellectual rights belong to Bandai Namco, the publisher intends to continue the series without Tarsier. In August 2023, Little Nightmares III was unveiled at Gamescom's Opening Night Live with an initial release window of 2024. Unlike its predecessors, the game is solely developed by Supermassive Games instead of the franchise's original developer. Supermassive had prior experience on the Little Nightmares franchise for developing the enhanced PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S ports of the previous game. In May 2024, the developer delayed its release to 2025. A tie-in podcast series, titled \"The Sounds of Nightmares\", was also announced and released its first two episodes on Bandai Namco Europe's YouTube channel on August 22."

Its story is inspired by the 2010 Marvel Comics limited series Captain America / Black Panther: Flags of Our Fathers, Set in Occupied Paris during World War II, and involves American super soldier Steve Rogers (Captain America) forming an uneasy alliance with Azzuri (Black Panther), the king of Wakanda, as they attempt to prevent the rise of the terrorist organization Hydra. The game was jointly announced by Skydance and Marvel Games in October 2021 as the first project to be produced from the former studio, alongside the involvement of studio heads Amy Hennig and Julian Beak as producers, with television and comics writer Marc Bernardin confirmed as writing the game alongside Hennig the following month. Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is scheduled to be released in 2025. The game will be an action-adventure video game where players will control an ensemble of four characters. In addition to the main protagonists Steve Rogers / Captain America and Azzuri / Black Panther, Howling Commandos member Gabriel Jones and Nanali, the leader of the Wakandan Spy Network, will be playable. In November 2019, Skydance Media asked video game director and writer Amy Hennig to establish a game division within the company. In October 2021, the division, as Skydance New Media, announced that the studio's first major project would be \"a narrative-driven, blockbuster action-adventure game\" developed in collaboration with Marvel Games, and featuring an original story. The following month, Marvel Comics writer and television producer Marc Bernardin revealed that he was involved as a writer, confirming that he had \"spent the better part of a year in the story mines\" creating the narrative. The game was teased during the D23 Expo showcase on September 9, 2022, revealing the game's ensemble cast and antagonist. In March 2024, Skydance and Marvel revealed the game's full title as Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra during Game Developers Conference (GDC) 2024, also presenting a story trailer that demonstrated the game's use of Unreal Engine 5 and its character animations. The cast was unveiled by Marvel, confirming that Khary Payton and Drew Moerlein would lead the ensemble as Azzuri and Steve Rogers respectively, alongside Marque Richardson as Gabriel Jones and Megalyn Echikunwoke as Nanali. Marvel announced that Joel Johnstone would portray Howard Stark, an ally of Captain America and a tech genius who is also the future father of Tony Stark, while Lyne Ren√©e would appear as Julie, an original character created for the game. Stephen Barton was revealed as the game's composer. Actress Janina Gavankar is confirmed to have a role. On July 29, 2024, Skydance New Media partnered with Plaion to publish Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra. Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is scheduled to be released in holiday of 2025."

        "text": "Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is an upcoming action-adventure game developed by Retro Studios and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch and the Nintendo Switch 2. Players control Samus Aran, who makes use of new psychic powers on the planet Viewros. Beyond is scheduled for release in 2025. Beyond was announced under the working title Metroid Prime 4 at E3 2017, and was reportedly initially developed by Bandai Namco Studios. In January 2019, Nintendo announced that development had restarted under Retro Studios, the developer of the previous Metroid Prime games. Kensuke Tanabe, who worked on all three Prime games, returned as a producer. Nintendo announced the title Beyond and released the first trailer in June 2024. Following the destruction of the Phazon, Samus Aran fights for survival on the planet Viewros and confronts foes including the rival bounty hunter Sylux. Beyond introduces psychic powers, which can be used to operate mechanisms and guide shots. In 2015, the producer Kensuke Tanabe said the next Metroid Prime game could involve the bounty hunter Sylux, who was introduced in Metroid Prime Hunters (2006). Sylux's gunship appeared in a special ending for Metroid Prime 3: Corruption (2007) unlocked after 100% completion, in pursuit of the player character, Samus Aran. Sylux also appeared in the special ending of Metroid Prime: Federation Force (2016), infiltrating a Galactic Federation research station and releasing an infant Metroid from a stasis tube. Nintendo announced Metroid Prime 4 during the Nintendo Direct presentation at E3 2017. Bill Trinen, the director of product marketing at Nintendo of America, confirmed that it would involve Tanabe but not Retro Studios, which had developed the previous Prime games. While not confirmed by Nintendo, Eurogamer reported that Prime 4 was being developed by Bandai Namco Studios in Japan and Singapore. The Bandai Singapore staff included former LucasArts staff who had worked on the canceled Star Wars 1313. The Nintendo of America president, Reggie Fils-Aim√©, said in 2018 that Metroid Prime 4 was \"well into development\" and \"proceeding well\". Nintendo did not show it at E3 2018; Trinen said they would share more when they \"had something that would wow people\". In January 2019, the Nintendo EPD general manager, Shinya Takahashi, announced that development had restarted under Retro Studios with Tanabe. Takahashi said that the previous studio had not met Nintendo's standards and that the decision to restart the project was not taken lightly. In October 2020, Retro posted a job advertisement seeking storyboard artists to work on \"emotional\" and \"interesting and innovative scenes that elevate the narrative\". Video Games Chronicle took this as an indication of a more cinematic focus. Nintendo released the first trailer and the title Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on June 18, 2024. It showcased similar gameplay to previous Metroid Prime games, with Samus exiting her gunship, exploring a forest world, using her morph ball ability, scanning a Space Pirate and encountering the bounty hunter Sylux, who first appeared in Metroid Prime Hunters. Nintendo also announced that Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is scheduled for release in 2025. It was nominated for Most Anticipated Game at the Game Awards 2024. Nintendo released a second trailer in a Direct presentation on March 27, 2025, introducing the forest planet Viewros setting, new enemies, the Lamorn race and Samus's psychic powers. In a Direct presentation on April 2, Nintendo announced a version for Nintendo Switch 2, with enhanced visual resolution, the option to use 4K at 60 frames per second or 1080p at 120 frames per second, and optional mouse controls when using the Joy-Con 2 controllers."

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewgenics",
        "text": "Mewgenics is an upcoming tactical role-playing roguelike life simulation video game developed by Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel. The game has players breed cats, which assume character classes and are sent out on adventures, featuring tactical combat on a procedurally-generated grid. Originally announced by Team Meat in 2012 as a follow-up to Super Meat Boy, the game experienced a protracted development cycle, before being cancelled and subsequently reacquired by McMillen for development with Glaiel in 2018. Mewgenics is tentatively set to be released via the digital distribution platform Steam in 2025. Mewgenics is a tactical role-playing game that is divided into two stages: combat and breeding. At the beginning of the game, the player is assigned a team of four cats, which feature character classes, such as hunter, mage and healer. The cats have varying statistics, as well as access to mana reserves, which influence their roles and performance. The cats may affect the aforementioned statistics by equipping clothing and other paraphernalia. Sent on a journey, the combat portion of the game principally takes place on a procedurally-generated grid with a two-dimensional isometric perspective, where the team must eliminate all the enemies, before advancing. Every character may move and use an active ability, with passive abilities affecting them. The combat is heavily influenced by the environment, with the weather affecting performance and the foliage being able to be manipulated for and against the cats. If a cat loses all its hit points, it will be incapacitated, yet remain in the battle, though it will suffer long-term consequences, such as brain damage ‚Äì and could still be killed with three subsequent blows from enemies. Should a cat die, its items will be lost, including any exclusive rarities that may only drop once. After a successful battle, the player may choose a cat to level up, thereby enhancing its abilities. The second stage of the game, breeding, comes into play once the player has completed their run. Surviving cats return to the house hub, carrying with them their statistics, as well as equipment that may be used by other cats. Two cats in the same room may mate, resulting in the breeding of a new cat that inherits their parents'traits. Inherited traits may produce cats that are ideal for further runs. Inbreeding, the act of breeding cats with closely related parents, results in offspring with mutations and other deficiencies. As simulated in-game time passes, cats die from old age. Following the release of the critically and commercially successful Super Meat Boy, artist Edmund McMillen and programmer Tommy Refenes of Team Meat began developing Mew-Genics. Announced in October 2012, the game was described by McMillen as being randomly generated, involving cats and the \"strangest project [he had] ever worked on\". Drawing inspiration from The Sims, Pok√©mon, Animal Crossing and the Tamagotchi, Mew-Genics featured turn-based strategy combat, while leaning heavily into house hub element. Cats could participate in various activities, such as beauty pageants and sewer races ‚Äì as well as be cryogenically frozen for longevity. The cats would engage bosses in a manner principally styled after Pok√©mon, with their opponents becoming progressively more difficult with every fight. The game was intended to be a multi-platform title, with iOS being the first announced platform, followed by Steam and Android. The game's soundtrack was composed by the two-member band Ridiculon, McMillen's repeat collaborators. Shortly after production began, McMillen and Refenes realized that they had underestimated the scope of Mew-Genics, with the game experiencing feature creep. Therefore, Team Meat temporarily shelved Super Meat Boy Forever, their planned handheld successor to Super Meat Boy, to prioritize Mew-Genics. It was originally planned to be released in 2014, with a playable build for attendees at PAX Prime in Seattle, Washington between August and September 2013, but Team Meat announced directly before the event that it would only be exhibited and not playable. The game was playable for the public at PAX East in Boston, Massachusetts, in April 2014, with Team Meat insisting it would still release that year. In August 2014, development of Mew-Genics was put on hold, with Refenes stating that the team would be working on refactoring the gameplay to make it more coherent. After two years of no development, McMillen confirmed in 2016 that Mew-Genics had been cancelled, while his focus would be on his new project, The Legend of Bum-bo. McMillen subsequently departed from Team Meat ‚Äì he credited the divergent interests of the co-owners, with Refenes looking to further develop the Meat Boy franchise, while he wanted to pursue new intellectual properties. In January 2018, McMillen announced in a blog post that he had secured the rights to Mewgenics (unhyphenated) from Team Meat and that the project would be developed with Tyler Glaiel, McMillen's collaborator from The End Is Nigh. The game's design would undergo a complete overhaul, with an anticipated release date several years away. While McMillen completed work on The Legend of Bum-bo, the final expansion for The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth called Repentance and the physical card game Tapeworm, Glaiel prototyped several gameplay variants for the rebooted Mewgenics. The genres Glaiel tested included brawler and real-time strategy, though he found them to be too chaotic. In early 2020, a turn-based tactical role-playing prototype moved forward as the game's design. The game was built upon an engine developed by Glaiel since 2010 that was capable of importing SVG assets created in Adobe Flash, which was previously utilized for development of The End Is Nigh. In October 2022, the official Steam page for Mewgenics was launched, touting it as a turn-based roguelike legacy game. The game was previewed by journalist Russ Frushtick of Polygon on Halloween 2022, detailing his playthrough, as well as McMillen and Glaiel's account of the game's development history. The game is projected to have a release on Steam in 2025."

        "text": "Ninja Gaiden 4 is an upcoming action-adventure game co-developed by Team Ninja and PlatinumGames, and published by Xbox Game Studios. It is the seventh mainline game in Koei Tecmo's Ninja Gaiden series, and the direct sequel to Ninja Gaiden 3 (2012). The game primarily follows a new character named Yakumo, though series'protagonist Ryu Hayabusa is also playable and has a significant role in the story. Ninja Gaiden 4 is set to be released worldwide for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S in late 2025. Ninja Gaiden 4 takes place a \"significant amount of time\" after Ninja Gaiden 3 in a near-future Tokyo, that was plunged into chaos by the return of the Dark Dragon, a malevolent entity behind the Dark Dragon Blade from Ninja Gaiden (2004), and main antagonist of Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword (2008). Under the influence of the Underworld, the city takes on a rainy cyberpunk -like aesthetic. According to the director, these unsettling conditions add to the game's core themes and the key concept of \"adversity\". A new protagonist, young ninja Yakumo, was introduced to make the game more approachable to new players. He fights using \"Bloodraven Form\", a technique that manipulates his blood and blood of the enemies to create powerful weapons that strike down many foes at once. The veteran Ryu Hayabusa serves as a \"major challenge and growth milestone\" for Yakumo, while also being playable throughout the story, utilizing similar moveset and tools to his earlier appearances. In addition, some of the series'signature moves, such as Izuna Drop and Flying Swallow, are available to both characters. The series developer, Team Ninja, wanted to bring Ninja Gaiden back amidst the growing gap since the last mainline installment and fan requests. As a result of a close relationship between the president of Koei Tecmo, Hisashi Koinuma, and the CEO of PlatinumGames, Atsushi Inaba, the two companies began exploring collaboration possibilities. With the support from Phil Spencer, CEO of Microsoft Gaming, they started work on a brand new Ninja Gaiden title. The game was produced by the head of Team Ninja and co-director of Ninja Gaiden 3, Fumihiko Yasuda, and PlatinumGames'Yuji Nakao. Nakao also directed the title together with Team Ninja's Masakazu Hirayama. Xbox Game Studios entered a partnership with Koei Tecmo, the owner of Ninja Gaiden IP, to publish the game worldwide. The company previously released Ninja Gaiden II (2008) for Xbox 360 and worked with PlatinumGames on the cancelled action role-playing game Scalebound. Ninja Gaiden 4 was announced alongside Ninja Gaiden 2 Black during the Xbox Developer Direct video presentation on January 23, 2025. It is scheduled to release in Q3/Q4 2025 for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S, and will be included with the Xbox Game Pass subscription from day one."

        "text": "The Outer Worlds 2 is an upcoming action role-playing game developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Xbox Game Studios. It is a standalone sequel to The Outer Worlds (2019), set in the Arcadia star system that has been colonized entirely by megacorporations. Players will assume control of the protagonist, an Earth Directorate Agent, who is tasked with uncovering the source of emerging rifts that threaten to destroy the colony amidst a factional war. The game is set to be released for PlayStation 5, Windows and Xbox Series X/S in 2025. As with its predecessor, the game is played from the first-person perspective and involves alternating between various combat, stealth and dialogue systems when encountering hostile non-playable characters in the overworld. The game also retains its predecessor's dialogue tree system which influences the branching story paths depending on how the player interacts with their party and other supporting characters throughout the narrative. The Outer Worlds 2 began development shortly following the release of the first game in 2019, and had entered full development two years later. Tim Cain, who co-directed the first game before leaving Obsidian in 2020, remained involved as a creative consultant during production. The Outer Worlds 2 is an action role-playing game that is played in first-person perspective. Players can use melee weapons and firearms to defeat enemies. The game features an expanded selection of weapons, better visuals, and an increased focus on action compared to the first game, according to Obsidian Entertainment. It will be set in a new solar system with a new cast of characters. During development of the first game, Obsidian Entertainment was acquired by Microsoft and integrated as a first-party developer for Xbox Game Studios in November 2018. While the arrangement did not affect the game's original distribution plans, Microsoft acquired all publishing duties for \"future iterations\" of The Outer Worlds from Private Division by May 2021. A sequel to the game had entered development in September 2019, two months before The Outer Worlds launched. In January 2024, The Outer Worlds director Tim Cain, who left Obsidian in 2020 and considered himself retired from the games industry, revealed that he remained attached to The Outer Worlds 2 as a creative consultant during its production. Cain praised the game's team as they had \"figured out\" a solution to a specific problem the developer had continued to struggle with across all his previous titles, referencing production notes he recalled from creating the original Fallout in 1997, and he frequently assisted staff in identifying \"pitfalls\" in the game's overall quality. In August 2024, Obsidian CEO Feargus Urquhart provided an update on the game, saying it \"is looking incredible\" despite conflicts with the game's planned production timeline. The Outer Worlds 2 was announced at the Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase during Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2021, where it was slated for release on Windows and Xbox Series X/S as a console-exclusive. At the time of announcement, the game had just entered full production, and the game's accompanying trailer broke the fourth wall by addressing the fact the studio did not have any gameplay or materials ready to be shown by then. A full trailer unveiling gameplay and story details was presented at The Game Awards (TGA) in December 2024, which additionally confirmed a 2025 launch window, making it the second Obsidian-developed title to release that year following Avowed that February. The game was also now slated to have a simultaneous multiplatform release, with a PlayStation 5 version planned to launch alongside the Xbox and PC releases. The game will be the subject of a special Direct presentation scheduled to air immediately following the Xbox Games Showcase on June 8, 2025. The Outer Worlds 2 is set to release for PlayStation 5, Windows and Xbox Series X/S in 2025."

        "title": "Palworld",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palworld",
        "text": "Palworld is an upcoming action-adventure, survival, and monster-taming game created and published by Japanese developer Pocketpair. The game is set in an open world populated with animal-like creatures called \"Pals\", which players can battle and capture to use for base building, traversal, and combat. Players may also assign the \"Pals\" to bases where they will automatically complete tasks for the player. Palworld can be played either solo or online with up to 32 players on one server. It was announced in 2021 and launched through early access for Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S in January 2024, and for the PlayStation 5 in September 2024. The game's comedic premise, which involves using firearms and equipping Pals with them, has earned it the nickname \" Pok√©mon with guns\". Other elements, such as using Pals for food or as manual labor in mines and factories, have also garnered attention. It was generally well received, with praise for its gameplay, content, and satirical premise, but criticism for its reliance on shock humor and use of unoriginal designs and mechanics. Palworld sold eight million units in its first six days of early access and reached over two million concurrent players on Steam, making it the third-highest played game of all time on the platform. As of February 22, 2024, the game has sold over 15 million units had attracted a global audience of more than 32 million players making it one of the best-selling PC games. In Palworld, players control a customizable avatar from a third-person perspective and explore the open-world Palpagos Islands. Players must manage their hunger level, craft basic tools, gather materials, and build bases that act as fast travel points. Unlocks through a technology tree allow the player to craft and use weapons, structures, and decorations. The islands are inhabited by 187 different types of creatures called Pals, which players directly engage in combat with to weaken and then capture using \"Pal Spheres\". Pals can also be bought on the black market through non-player characters or traded with other players. After obtaining Pals, they can be summoned to battle or stationed at bases to assist with tasks such as scavenging, crafting, and cooking depending on their type. Each Pal has a Partner Skill, allowing further utility by using them as weapons or mounts. The game's bosses include various factions, such as the Rayne Syndicate, the Free Pal Alliance liberation movement, the Brothers of the Eternal Pyre, the Palpagos Islands Defense Force, and the Pal Genetic Research Unit. These factions are led by powerful Pal trainers who reside in towers across the islands and are the game's main boss battles. The factions include human NPCs who occasionally spawn in the world, either patrolling or battling each other, who are hostile to the player and can fight them with weapons. The game features a wanted level system; if the player commits a crime, usually against humans, other human NPCs will become hostile and defense force troopers will spawn to attack them until they are killed or evade their pursuers. Palworld is being developed and published by Pocketpair, an independent doujin soft company based in Shinagawa, Tokyo. It is their second early access open world survival project, following Craftopia. Like it, it uses gameplay mechanics reminiscent of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but has added creature-collecting mechanics popularized by the Pok√©mon franchise. Pocketpair said that Pok√©mon was not one of their main inspirations. According to CEO Takuro Mizobe, the concept of Palworld is based on Ark: Survival Evolved, which also had monster companions in dinosaurs; the survival mechanics and in-game tasks were inspired by Rust. RimWorld was also cited as a major inspiration for the game. The game uses more original assets than Craftopia, which proved to be challenging for the team. Early in development, it was decided to move Palworld from Unity, which powered Pocketpair's earlier projects, to Unreal Engine 4, as they decided it was more suitable for heavier open-world games. It was first planned for release in 2022, but the deadline was extended to August 2023 as the scope of the project grew and the company hired more staff, and then once again to support dedicated servers on launch. When early access began, the game was estimated to be 60% complete. In total, the budget exceeded 1 billion yen, and the company hired over 40 additional employees. The game's character animator was hired, despite having no prior industry experience, after Takuro Mizobe reached out to a hobbyist animator on YouTube who had been uploading combat animation videos and Girls'Frontline fan content. The game's director applied during a Twitter recruitment run despite already lining up for a position at NetEase. The main character designer for the Pals was initially rejected during an October 2020 recruitment drive for illustrators, but was hired when she reapplied in February 2021. The game was revealed on June 5, 2021, detailing key features such as survival, crafting, exploration, exploitation of creatures, and the multiplayer focus. More details were shared over the following years, and the game appeared as part of presentations such as Tokyo Game Show, where Pocketpair announced the release for Xbox consoles in addition to PC, and Summer Game Fest, where they revealed an early access launch window in January 2024. Palworld was released on January 19, 2024, through Steam Early Access and Xbox Game Preview, and is available with Game Pass from day one. The game is expected to remain in early access until at least 2025. Planned features for future updates include PvP modes, guild raids, and cross-server Pal trading. On June 10, 2024, it was announced that the game would be released in early access for macOS later that year. On June 24, 2024, it was teased to be released on PlayStation 5. Pocketpair announced the first major expansion to be released on June 27, 2024, which includes new Pals, a new island called Sakurajima, and other new content. On September 25, 2024, the PlayStation 5 version of the game was released. On December 23, 2024, the production team released a major update Feybreak Island. On March 19, 2025 Palworld Update 0.5.0 added crossplay across all platforms. The game's reveal trailer was met with high engagement on social media and mixed reception, ranging from excitement to disgust. The phrase \" Pok√©mon with guns\" was commonly used to refer to the game by both players and journalists. Some viewers thought that the game was fake, a sentiment that surprised the development team. It also received some skepticism due to the unfinished state of the developer's earlier work, Craftopia. The satirical tone of promotional material, with references to labor laws and illegal hunting, sparked interest in the game exploring the dark undertones of the creature-collecting genre. In Brazil, the game's publicity was boosted due to the pronunciation of pal being similar to pau in Portuguese. Pau can mean'wood'but is also sexual slang for penis. Both players and journalists made various puns when discussing the game and the Pals due to this double meaning. Palworld received mostly positive reviews from critics. IGN and PC Invasion praised its fun combat and engaging gameplay loop, with the latter noting the large, albeit somewhat barren, environments being brought to life by different Pals. The Escapist described the combat allowing players to fight alongside their Pals against tougher enemies as a high point. PCGamesN called the game \"a morbidly compelling descent into creature capitalism \", stating that though it had some flaws, such as its insistence on ethically questionable behavior and the unoriginal designs of Pals, its gameplay and the open world made up for it. GameSpot praised the game's mechanics and tone as a \"refreshing perspective in a genre so often tripping over itself to present things as joyous and heartfelt\", believing it to represent the first time \"a creature collector game has owned up to its exploitation-as-gameplay systems.\" Conversely, Rock Paper Shotgun and PC Gamer criticized Palworld for relying too heavily on shock humor about animal abuse and sweatshop labor in its gameplay, which PC Gamer derided as \"mid-2000s Newgrounds edgelord \" and \"over-committing to the bit\", with Rock Paper Shotgun arguing the gameplay mechanics and presentation of Pals fundamentally misunderstood the meanings and appeal behind Pok√©mon and the monster-catching genre. It also attracted some criticism for the unoriginal designs of Pals and mechanics lifted from other titles, which VG247 thought undermined a game \"worth admiring\". Palworld sold over one million copies in its first eight hours of early access on January 19, 2024, which rose to two million copies within the first 24 hours, three million copies within the first 40 hours, five million copies by day 3, six million by day 4, seven million by day 5, and eight million by day 6. On January 24, 2024, it reached over 2,000,000 concurrent players on Steam, becoming the first game since PUBG: Battlegrounds to achieve this feat. The high player count led to server issues. On January 27, Palworld recorded 2,101,867 concurrent players on Steam. By February 1, the game sold 12 million copies on Steam and had reached 7 million players on Xbox. According to Microsoft, the game was the most-played 3rd party release on Xbox Game Pass, reaching a peak of almost 3 million daily active players on the Xbox platform. As of February 22, 2024, the game sold 15 million copies on Steam and had reached 10 million players on Xbox. However, by February 11, the game reportedly faced the largest two-week player drop on Steam - down from its peak concurrent player count of 2,101,867 to about 750,000 concurrent players. In response to those reports, Pocketpair community manager Bucky wrote on Twitter \"This emerging'Palworld has lost X% of its player base'discourse is lazy, but it's probably also a good time to step in and reassure those of you capable of reading past a headline that it is fine to take breaks from games.\" He also wrote \"If you are still playing Palworld, we love you. If you're no longer playing Palworld, we still love you, and we hope you'll come back for round two when you're ready.\" As of February 2025, Palworld has attracted over 32 million players across all platforms, including PC via Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation 5. Shortly after release, users on Twitter alleged similarities between the designs of several Pals and Pok√©mon, with a user claiming to show evidence of plagiarism of game assets. However, the CEO of Pocketpair stated that the character concepts were mostly designed by a single graduate student hired in 2021 following the company's public recruitment run for new illustrators. He also states that the game has cleared legal reviews. On January 24, The Pok√©mon Company issued a statement indirectly citing the game, writing: \"[We] have received many inquiries regarding another company's game released in January 2024 [...] we intend to investigate and take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to the Pok√©mon.\" Pocketpair's CEO stated that the company has received death threats from users on Twitter. Nintendo and The Pok√©mon Company filed a lawsuit against Pocketpair for infringement of patent rights on September 19, 2024. Pocketpair responded to the lawsuit the same day, expressing disappointment that resources would have to be allocated to the lawsuit and that they were currently unaware of what patents had been infringed upon. In December, Nintendo filed a series of patents in the United States designed to challenge Pocketpair in court there as well. In February 2025, just one of the 23 patents were approved."

As opposed to previous Pok√©mon games which featured turn-based combat, Legends: Z-A uses a real-time combat system that takes into account the positioning of the player character, their Pok√©mon, and the timing of used moves, and allows Pok√©mon to move around and dodge attacks while in a battle. New to the title is the ability to launch pre-emptive strikes on opposing trainers that wander Lumiose City during nighttime hours, while opposing trainers are capable of the same technique and can stun your Pok√©mon for a few seconds. There also exist side quests in the form of bonus cards that the player can find and fulfill the objectives of to achieve points for accessing rank promotion battles (which are also rewarded when beating enemy trainers). The game will take place in the Kalos region, which is based on France and was first introduced in the 2013 video games Pok√©mon X and Y. According to its trailer, the plot takes place during an urban redevelopment project in Lumiose City, which is based on Paris, being undertaken by a company called Quasartico, Inc. Nintendo of America has stated that the game will take place entirely within Lumiose City, where Pok√©mon coexist with humans in locations known as Wild Zones. During nighttime hours, the Wild Zones become Battle Zones for the Z-A Royale, where trainers wander and can challenge and be challenged by the player to Pok√©mon battles. The player character's goal is to advance from Rank Z to Rank A via promotion battles with certain trainers to have a wish granted. During the course of the story, the legendary Pok√©mon Zygarde takes an interest in the player character. On 27 February 2024, Legends Z-A was announced during a Pok√©mon Presents presentation with a release window of'2025'. At the end of the trailer, the Mega Evolution mechanic, which was first introduced in X and Y, was also confirmed to return. Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A is being developed by Game Freak. During the next Pok√©mon Presents, on 27 February 2025, a second video was released, giving more information on the plot and gameplay elements with an updated release window of'late 2025'. During the Nintendo Direct on 2 April 2025, it was confirmed that Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A will get an upgraded version on Nintendo Switch 2 alongside with many other Nintendo Switch games."

        "text": "Spine is an upcoming action-adventure beat'em up game developed and published by Nekki for Windows, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch 2. The game follows Redline, a street artist who is fitted with a sentient combat implant called Spine, as she fights against an oppressive AI regime to find her captured brother. The game combines elements of gun fu, third-person shooter, and cyberpunk, and is inspired by the John Wick films. It is scheduled for a 2025 release. Spine is an action-adventure beat'em up game set in a dystopian cyberpunk world. Players take on the role of the female protagonist, Redline, a rebellious graffiti artist who acquires gun fu skills after receiving the titular spinal implant, which serves as her sentient AI companion and gives her new combat abilities throughout the game. Redline must rescue her captive brother from the autocratic AI regime known as Tensor, while fighting street thugs, mafia bosses, and trained assassins, some of whom are also similarly augmented by implants. Spine's gameplay is centered around close-quarters combat with firearms, as Redline performs various combos based on the weapons she wields. It comprises around 20 missions, each designed like a standalone short film and set in cinematic environments. The player can snatch and use enemies'weapons and use Redline's spraycan to blind enemies. The game also incorporates parkour and acrobatic elements. The game will feature a hardcore mode wherein the player must complete all missions without taking a single hit. Spine was announced in August 2021 by Nekki, the creators of Shadow Fight series and Vector, and was originally conceptualized as a PvP game. In December 2023, Nekki announced that the game would be repositioned as a single-player narrative action game based on fast-paced combat, and released a trailer of the gameplay. The game runs on Unreal Engine 5, and also uses its own custom data shaders and Nekki's proprietary 3D animation software called Cascadeur. Art director Alexander Nemov stated that while the game's story and visuals are based on the cyberpunk genre, the game adopts a modern feel instead of the typical retrofuturistic theme. He added that the game is intended as \"a warning of sorts against a digital dystopia.\" The developers have cited the John Wick film series and the works of John Woo, who popularized the gun fu genre in Hong Kong cinema, as main inspirations for the game. A gameplay trailer released at the Future Games Show at 2024 Gamescom contained references to various films that inspired the game and featured music composed by Le Castle Vania, who had previously worked on the aforementioned John Wick series. Early reviews likened the gameplay to Sifu (2022) and Batman: Arkham Knight (2015). In late 2023, a nine-episode webtoon, which serves as a prologue to the game's storyline, was released. In April 2024, Variety reported that Nekki, in collaboration with Story Kitchen, was planning to develop a television series adaptation of the game. Game director Dmitry Pimenov remarked that Spine would be a transmedia project, with web comics, merchandise, board games, and potential film and television adaptations being planned alongside the game."
